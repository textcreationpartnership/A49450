            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>J. LUDOLPHUS TO THE Courteous Reader.</head>
            <p>AT length I preſent you with my <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Hiſtorie, long-promis'd, long expected by my friends. Nor will this delay be wonder'd at by thoſe that conſider how I am ty'd to public duty and employment, utterly diſſonant from theſe ſort of Studies. Beſide which, there were many other Reaſons. For I had collected indeed the Body of the matter from the Writings and Diſcourſes of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Habeſſinian,</hi> but the Circumſtances of time and place, and the names of perſons were yet wanting. So that there was Timber and Bricks for the Building, but only Lime and Cement was wanting. Moreover after ſo many Fables had been Printed upon this ſubject, I thought it would not be ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently done to utter more novelty upon the credit of one ſingle perſon; leſt a new truth might be lookt upon as a new Tale. At length having got into my hands <hi>Balthazer Tellez,</hi> from whom as well to ſupply what I wanted, as alſo to confirm what might ſeem to be doubtfull, yet then likewiſe I wanted Leiſure. Which when the moſt Serene <hi>Saxo-Gotan</hi> Dukes had indulg'd me, I Tranſlated my family to <hi>Frankfort</hi> upon the <hi>Main,</hi> to the end that I might have the benefit of ſeveral famous Libraries in that Noble City, and the opportunity of a Learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and by that means accompliſh my intended work, which by Gods Aſſiſtance I did in ſix weeks.</p>
            <p>After this, when all was ready for the Preſs, there ſtill wanted what was neceſſary to forward the Publiſhing of this work. A proper <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſis</hi> to tranſcribe the whole matter, and to attend upon the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Impreſſion; which my occaſions would not permit me to do; and then in the next place ſuch Forraign Characters as this work requir'd, which Impediments were alſo at laſt remov'd. For there was a certain Young Gentleman recommended to me, eminent for his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and integritie, by name <hi>John Henry, Majus,</hi> a Student in Theology, and the Oriental Tongues. Who being well skill'd in the Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the Dialect of the Rabbins, by my help eaſily made himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> and ſo fitted himſelf for the imployment I deſign'd Him. He therefore by my directions made the heads of the Chapters, the Sections, the Index, and Tranſlated the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> into Latin, aſſiſted the work and put it forward, taking upon him the whole Correction of it: For which reaſon I can recommend his deſerts the more juſtly to all good and learned Men.</p>
            <p>The Printing part was undertaken by <hi>Balthaſar Chriſtopher Wuſtius,</hi> as well for that he was well known among Forainers, as becauſe he had a Printing Houſe furniſhed with all ſorts of Letters for Foraign Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. He alſo cauſed the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> and <hi>Amharic</hi> Characters to be engrav'd in Copper by the famous <hi>John Adolphus Schmide,</hi> and afterwards to be caſt for farther uſe. But theſe could not be brought to perfection, ſo ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:59633:3"/>
as the Compoſiters requir'd, and therefore there was a neceſſitie of mixing ſome old and leſs elegant, with the new and neater Characters.</p>
            <p>As to the Work it ſelf, I have ſaid enough in the Proem: No man underſtandeth the warts and defects better than my ſelf. Therfore I reſolv'd to deferr the Publiſhing till newer and fuller relations return'd out of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> or that I might receive them from the bordering Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being furniſhed for that purpoſe with very great and moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Recommendations, till I had brought my deſign to a full and elaborate perfection. But many Illuſtrious men, and my moſt honour'd friends, interceded with me, telling me, <hi>That never any thing came forth perfect at firſt in all its parts: And that therefore this Hiſtory was no longer to be conceal'd from the Chriſtian and Learned World, which it concerned to know theſe things: For that if any thing ſhould fall out hereafter worthy of remark, it might be put into an Appendix, or added to a new Edition.</hi> Which makes me hope for pardon from the more Candid Reader, if his deſire or expectation be not ſatisfied in all particulars. For I relate not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things beheld with my own eyes, but what I have either read my ſelf or heard from others, yet congruous to Truth and well cohering between themſelves. If I have not reach'd the ſence of my Authors, I will amend upon admonition; or elſe return my thanks and ſatisfaction to the admoniſher. That I ſhould pleaſe all men, a thing which never mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal yet attained, none in prudence can exact from me; nor dare I hope to have done it. However I propoſe to my ſelf to injure no man, but every where to ſtudy moderation. So they who take offence, ought to be offended with my Authors not with me. There are ſome perhaps who believe I might have ſpoken more in matter of Religion, others that I have ſaid too much, certainly I had rather I could have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all; ſo ungratefull to me are the Altercations of Chriſtians among themſelves in matters of Religion, chiefly where the Deciſions tend to Force and Arms. For they who think mutual Love and Charity is only due to men of their own ſect, certainly wander much from the ſcope of Chriſtian perfection, according to the precepts of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>I have not aim'd at my own advantage, nor my own increaſe of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, hard to be acquir'd, now the world is ſo fertile in ſoaring Genius's, I have only endeavoured to be in ſome meaſure profitable to the Commonwealth of Chriſtianity and Learning, out of a peculiar kindneſs, to that, for ought we know, moſt ancient Nation of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſines:</hi> I confeſs I have frequently bewail'd their misfortune for this, that the enmitie ran ſo high between them and the Portugueſſes, that for their ſakes all the other Europeans are ſuſpected to that Nation, and not permitted to have any commerce among them. But it has afforded me much more matter of grief, that there ſhould be ſuch and ſo great Animoſity nmong the Weſtern Chriſtians, that as things ſtand, there is no Counſell or help to be afforded for the eaſe and reſtitution of the Eaſtern Church, or for the ſuppreſſion of thoſe Barbarous <hi>Idolaters.</hi>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF ETHIOPIA: OR THE KINGDOM <hi>of the</hi> ABESSINES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am now about to write the Hiſtory of the <hi>Abeſſines;</hi> concerning whom, there have been many large, but few true Relations. For theſe People having tranſlated themſelves from the Maritime Regions of the <hi>Arabian Gulf,</hi> into the more upland Parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> by reaſon their Commerce with Foreigners has been very inconſiderable, have been known to very few of the <hi>Europeans.</hi> Beſides that the Name of <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> which they aſſume to themſelves, is common to ſo many Nations, that it has render'd their Hiſtory very ambiguous; for that many things generally ſpoken of the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> were more particularly attributed to the <hi>Abeſſines.</hi> Neither were they wanting to their own honour, while they appropriated to themſelves whatever was ſaid either in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or elſewhere to their advantage.</p>
            <p>Others there are, who to waſt their idle hours, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning ſome fabulous Inventions, or to repreſent the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of ſome Imaginary Common-Wealth, have choſen <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for the Subject of their Diſcourſe. Believing they could not more pleaſantly Romance, or more ſafely licenſe

Age, and then an Exile, for that contrary to the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he had followed the Fathers of the Society into <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and conſequently exerciſed in Misfortune, he had laid aſide all <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> the Vices of <hi>Fortunate Youth.</hi> So that although in truth, I was ſufficiently able, by vertue of his Inſtructions, and the knowledge which I obtained from him of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Language, to have out done all thoſe that have gone before me, yet I was unwilling to refell the Errors of others upon the Credit of one ſingle Perſon, till I had more Authorities to ſupport me.</p>
            <p>Nor did I therefore underake this difficult Task, only to conſume my leiſure hours in confuting the Errors, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering up the different Opinions of Authors, without any proſpect of <hi>Publick-Benefit.</hi> The Hiſtory it ſelf of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſerves the Labour of an Accurate Pen. For whether you conſider the Temper of the Clime, or the Condition of the Soyl, you ſhall hardly find in any other Part of the World more frequent Miracles of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Countrey is ſituated between the <hi>Tropic of Cancer,</hi> and the <hi>Equinoctial Line,</hi> and enjoys a wonderful variety of Air: The Champion Levels feel the Heat, the Hilly Parts are no leſs ſubject to Cold. For this reaſon, the Thunders are moſt dreadful, and frequent Tempeſts terrifie both Man and Beaſts. Their Prodigious Mountains over-look the Clouds themſelves. Neither <hi>Olympus</hi> nor <hi>Athos,</hi> here accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wonders; nor <hi>Atlas</hi> it ſelf, which the Ancients fancied to be the Support of Heaven, are to be compared with them. Their Rocks of various Shapes and Figures, ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zingly ſteep as not to be aſcended, yet inhabited. Their ſurrounded Valleys rugged, and repreſenting <hi>Abyſſes</hi> for profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Metals they alſo have; but chiefly Gold, did they know how to find and dig it forth. Their dryeſt places in Winter are overflowed in Summer: For thoſe Advantages which the Rains afford the Fields in other places, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſupply in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Among thoſe Rivers, <hi>Nilus</hi> for vaſtneſs and fame, far exceeds all the Rivers of the whole World: Whoſe Fountains ſo diligently ſought by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are not only here found, but it alſo now appears, that the River <hi>Niger</hi> is no more than its left Channel. Nor do all the Rivers of <hi>Habaſſia,</hi> as in other Places, empty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Sea, but are ſome of them ſuckt up in the Sand; ſo that it is more difficult to find the Mouths of thoſe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59633:7"/>
than the Sources of other Streams. Plants they have of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Vertue; and Beaſts of all ſorts, many of which are unknown to us. The largeſt alſo both of Foul and four-footed Beaſts are here to be found. The celebrated Unicorn, ſo curiouſly ſought for in all other Corners of the World, was firſt ſeen here. Cattel without number, much larger than ours, feed in the vaſt Woods, affording Paſture ſufficient as well for the Wild as Tame. Nor is the variety of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and People leſs to be admired; ſo ſtrangely differing in Language, Cuſtoms, and Ceremonies, that it may be thought ſome diſtinct Part of the World, rather than a particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>However all <hi>Abeſſinia</hi> Obeys one King, who by reaſon of certain Princes that are ſubject to him, calls himſelf <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſa nagaſt zait joperia,</hi> King of the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> He derives his Deſcent from <hi>Solomon</hi> King of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by an ambitious, tho dubious Claim; defending the long ſeries of his Family, whether true or falſe, with the force of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. However it be, this is certain, That the Monarchy of the <hi>Abeſſines,</hi> and the Royal Line, are no leſs Ancient than any among the <hi>Europeans.</hi> And for their Power, they were formerly more Potent than any other of the <hi>African</hi> Kings: But their Wars in the preceding Age with the <hi>Adelenſes,</hi> has brought them very low. Afterwards they were ſo debilitated by the Fury of the <hi>Gallani,</hi> that <hi>Abeſſinia</hi> is ſcarce to be found in <hi>Habeſſinia</hi> it ſelf, if you compare it with what it was in the times of <hi>Alvarezius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which deſerves the greateſt admiration is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the Chriſtian Religion, which firſt began under S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> at what time <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> Preached among them; the Opinions and Ceremonies of which Church they ſtill retain. So that many Primitive Rites in other Places obſolete, are here ſtill in Uſe. But that deplorable Schiſm which aroſe in the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> for which they alledge other Cauſes than our Writers do, withdrew the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> all together from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, at that time Flouriſhing; while they followed the Patriarch of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and rejected the Patriarch of the <hi>Melchites.</hi> Yet all this while for ſo many Ages they have ſuffered no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Change in their Divine Worſhip till the beginning of this laſt Century, at what time being ſplit into Diviſions by the Artifices of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> they have been cruelly ſhaken
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59633:8"/>
with Civil Diſcord and Bloody Wars; ſome Adhering to the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> other the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>Of which and other things it is our Deſign to treat more fully in this our Hiſtory; and ſo to handle the matter, as to diſcourſe in the Firſt Book, Of Natural Things; as the Situation and Names of the ſeveral Counties, the Temper of the Climate, the Condition of the Soyl, the ſeveral Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Languages of the Nations and Inhabitants. In the Second Book, Of the Political Government, the Succeſſion of their Kings, their Laws, their Acts of War, the Revenue of the Kingdom, and the like. In the Third, Of their Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, the beginning of the Chriſtian Religion, and its Advance in thoſe Countries, their Differences with the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church.

                  <p>THE Regions of which <hi>Ethiopia</hi> conſiſts, are neither equally, nor with the ſame obſervance of number, but variouſly ſet down. Moſt of them enjoy the Name of the Kingdom, <hi>Mengheſt,</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in General; perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ancient times they had their proper Princes and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Laws, as we know that formerly <hi>Spain</hi> was divided into ſeveral Kingdoms of the ſame nature. The reſt, in the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haric</hi> Dialect, are called <hi>Shumet,</hi> Prefectures, which are not however Governed by <hi>Vice-Roys,</hi> but are under peculiar Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of their own; which being confounded with the Kingdoms ſo call'd,<note place="margin">Hiſt. l. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> muſt needs render the number of the Kingdoms uncertain. <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> diſtinguiſhes the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> into more than forty Kingdoms; others add yet more, which are more eaſily ſet down in writing, than demonſtrated.<note place="margin">In Epiſt.

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Vulgar Chorographic Table or Mapp of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſinia,</hi> and the Author's new one.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The New Mapp of the <hi>Habeſſines.</hi> The new one found fault with as Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: Look'd on as ridiculous by <hi>Gregory;</hi> by reaſon of the ill writing and becauſe of the ill underſtood Names of <hi>Barnagaſſus, Tigremahon, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biancantiva,</hi> which are explained. The ambiguous powers of Letters. Advice to concert a certain Geographical Alphabet. The Authors conteſt about his own Mapps.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUT to the End that all things may the more clearly appear, we ſhall produce a new Chorographical Mapp of <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> the old one that goes begging about the World for an Author, being altogether uncertain. I was not a little aſham'd to hear the ſedulous <hi>Ethiopian, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> upbraiding as he did, the vanity and careleſneſs of our People, to obtrude ſuch abſurdities upon the Commonweal of Learning, and to defile otherwiſe moſt<note n="(h)" place="bottom">As thoſe of <hi>Ortelius, Janſonius;</hi> the <hi>Atlas</hi>'s of <hi>Gerand, Mercator, Bleau,</hi> and others.</note> beautiful Pieces of Geography, with ſuch fabulous impertinencies. While they made public to the World Mapps of ſuch conſequence,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59633:16"/>
without any ſufficient Authority, or any light by what Pen, of what Nation, or in what Language they were firſt written, as if they deſigned on purpoſe to deceive the Reader, that ſo he might not be in a Capacity to judge of the Truth: which if it were their aim, they did not miſs of their intentions, in regard they led ſeveral perſons, otherwiſe eminent, and of great judgment, into foul miſtakes, who cryed up the Empire of the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> for the largeſt in the World, as being little leſs than all <hi>Europe,</hi> too unwarily truſting to their fictions.</p>
                  <p>When I firſt ſhewed the vulgar Mapps to <hi>Gregory,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I made him laugh, ſometimes I made him angry. For before I call'd to mind that the <hi>Latin</hi> Letters were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced after the <hi>Portugal</hi> mannet, I asked him concerning the Kingdoms of <hi>Xoa, Gojam,</hi> and other Regions, from whence the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> had either taken away, or to which they had added the <hi>Latin</hi> Letters, <hi>a, d, do,</hi> as being their Articles of declenſion,<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>As</hi> Abugno, <hi>for</hi> Bugna, Barua; <hi>worſe</hi> Barua, <hi>for</hi> Dobarua; Amara <hi>for</hi> Amhara; Ambadora, <hi>for</hi> Ambadarho, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> without any regard to the Letter <hi>h.</hi> But when I expected an Anſwer, he knew not what I meant, till I pronounced for <hi>Ksoa, Shoa;</hi> for <hi>Goyam, Gojam,</hi> and ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: But he laughed outright when I queſtion'd him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdoms of <hi>Barnagaſſus, Tigremahon,</hi>
                     <note n="(k)" place="bottom">In the vulgar Tables alſo you ſhall find <hi>Tigre</hi> and <hi>Tigray,</hi> as if they were two diſtinct Kingdoms: Which error <hi>B. Telles</hi> ſeverely reprehends. <hi>L. 1. Ch. 4.</hi>
                     </note> and <hi>Ambiancantiva.</hi> For after a ſhort heſitation he underſtood them to be compound words, in which the Titles of the <hi>Vice-Roys,</hi> were conjoyned with the Names of the Regions over which they were made Governors; and beſides that, very much corrupted by the <hi>Portugal</hi> pronunciation and ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For <hi>Barnagaſſo</hi> in the <hi>Amharic</hi> Language extends it ſelf to <hi>Bahr-Nagaſh,</hi> a compound word of <hi>Bahr</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Sea, and <hi>Nagaſh</hi> a Governour, as much as to ſay a Commander or Admiral at Sea. <hi>Tigremahon</hi> corruptly for <hi>Tigre-macuonen,</hi> that is to ſay, Judge or Preſident of <hi>Tigre: Ambian-cantiva,</hi> for <hi>Dembea-cantiba,</hi> that is, Governour or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Dembea.</hi> The ſame inference happens to the moſt noble City and Court of Royal Reſidence, <hi>Axuma,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appears in the Mapps, by reaſon that the <hi>Portugals</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Axum, Acaſſum;</hi> for they caſt away the <hi>A,</hi> as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of declenſion, and adding their own termination <hi>O,</hi> made
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59633:16"/>
it <hi>Caſſumo.</hi> Upon which City we ſtood pauſing a long time, before we could tell what to make of it. I paſs by an innumerable company of other miſtakes, which rendred the Mapp altogether uſeleſs to me. Nor is it to be doubted but the ſame thing often falls out in other Exotic Tables: So that unleſs a Man can divine the Language of the Author, or where he was born; it is impoſſible but he muſt read the Names of the plaes moſt extravagantly. For we find that becauſe the Modern <hi>Europeans</hi> have no Letters of their own, but onely have accommodated the <hi>Latin</hi> Letters to their own ſounds, it comes to paſs, that one and the ſame Letter is variouſly pronounced by various Nations; which frequently appears in Conſonants conjoyned. As for Example, <hi>Ch,</hi> among the <hi>Germans, Belgians</hi> and <hi>Polonians,</hi> is a rough Aſpiration like the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ח, or the <hi>Greek</hi> Χ. Among the <hi>Italians Ch,</hi> is pronounced like a <hi>k,</hi> among the <hi>French</hi> like an <hi>Hebrew</hi> ש. But among the <hi>Engliſh, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who alone genuinely pronounce the word <hi>China,</hi> there is a kind of hiſſing compos'd between the Letter <hi>Z.</hi> and <hi>ſch.</hi> which the <hi>Italians</hi> expreſs by a <hi>C</hi> before <hi>e</hi> or <hi>i;</hi> the <hi>Polonians</hi> by <hi>Ch,</hi> the <hi>Hebrews</hi> more lively in their ש, the <hi>Germans <hi>Sch,</hi>
                     </hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by <hi>Sh,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ch, the <hi>Italians</hi> Sc before <hi>e,</hi> and <hi>i;</hi> and which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> would do by their Letter <hi>X,</hi> but that they are unwilling to have it a ſuperfluous Letter in their Alphabet.</p>
                  <p>For which reaſon it would be very requiſite, that the Publiſhers of Foraign Mapps, ſhould alſo Publiſh their Inſtructions, and tell the World according to what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation, the Names of Countries and Cities ought to be read: Or elſe that in the compiling of ſome univerſal Geographical Work, care might be taken to add ſuch an Index as ſhould be the ſtandard of Pronunciation in every Country, to prevent the common miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>We muſt acknowledge that our Chorographick Table is not without its defects: For though <hi>Gregorie</hi> were ſufficiently skill'd in the Names and Situation of places, yet he was ignorant of the Degrees of the Sphere and Elevation of the Pole. Therefore in the firſt Mapps of <hi>Habeſſinia</hi> which I made, I follow'd the Longitude and Latitude of the vulgar Tables; but becauſe I found them falſe in that too, we thought it more prudence not to Publiſh any at all. I muſt confeſs being in company with certain Perſons of Learning

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Air uncertain. Wonderful effects of heat. The <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> is nevertheleſs habitable. The high places cold. No Snow. The temper and wholeſomneſs of the Air. Horrid Thunders. A dirty Winter deſcrib'd by <hi>Gregory.</hi> Diverſity of Tempeſts in the ſame ſituation. The four ſeaſons of the year different from the <hi>Europeans.</hi> The beginning of the Spring the 25th. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> They have only three ſeaſons of the year; the days and nights almoſt always equal. Their dawnings and evenings very ſhort. The moſt impetuous wind, call'd a <hi>Snake.</hi> The two ſorts of Whirl-winds, <hi>Preſtor</hi> and <hi>Typhon,</hi> moſt raging and pernicious.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN ſo many and ſuch various Regions, the Conſtitution of the Air is as various. In low and open places which the <hi>Abeſſines</hi> call <hi>Kolla,</hi> the heat of the Sun is intolerable, ſuch as <hi>Seneca</hi> deſcribes in theſe words. <hi>The ſtones burn as if neal'd in the fire, not onely in the middle of the day, but alſo toward the evening, the Silver unſoders; the footſteps of men are impatient of the ſcorching ſand. The faſtening of the ſtandard melts:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59633:17"/>
No exterior covering of outward Ornament remains.</hi> In which reſpect both coaſts of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> have but a bad report; as alſo the Iſlands, eſpecially <hi>Suaquena,</hi> whoſe heat <hi>Gregorie</hi> many times us'd to call <hi>Infernal.</hi> For ſaid he, it excoriates the <hi>Skin, melts hard Indian wax in a Cabinet, and ſears your ſhoos, like a red hot Iron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Perſons conſider'd not the nature of thoſe People; that inhabit that Country; much leſs have they weighed with themſelves, the ſtrange Patience of thoſe that covet rule and dominion, who can endure the parching beams of the Sun, and willingly too, though unus'd to thoſe immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate violences of raging heat. However the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were in a very great error that believ'd the<note n="(m)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Ariſtot. Meteorotog.</hi> L. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> and his followers.</note> 
                     <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> unhabitable; or that the middle parts of the Earth, where the Sun continually moves, ſhould be parch'd up with flames, and toſted with the raging fire.<note n="(n)" place="bottom">The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Proverb, he that is intent upon his own Intereſt, minds not in conveniences.</note> Aſſuredly there are ſome Philoſophers who deliver things uncertain and unprov'd for real and aſſured truths, and diſcourſe in ſuch a manner of the nature of the Air, the Heavens and the Stars, as if their reſidence had long been there. For that the Air is colder upon the Mountains, all Nations in their own Countries find by experience; but that the Air is cold of it ſelf, and not warmed but by the repercuſſion of the Suns beams among the exhalations of the Earth, is the opinion of other ſage Philoſophers: which exhalations in the lower Region near the Earth riſe more cloſe and condens'd, in the upper parts, more thin and rarify'd; ſo that tho the lower parts frie with heat, high places freez, the cool nature of the Air not ſuffering any alteration through the defect of heat.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the higher you aſcend the Mountains of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> from the coaſt of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> the more temperate you ſhall feel the Air; inſomuch that as <hi>Tellezius</hi> witneſſes in many Regions of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the Summer heats are more mild then in <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſo many degrees diſtant toward the North. Nay there are ſome Mountainous Countries, as in <hi>Samen</hi> where the cold is more dreaded than the heat. Nevertheleſs there falls none or very little Snow in thoſe parts, only a certain ſmall ſort of Hail ſometimes covers the ground, which at a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59633:18"/>
diſtance looks like Snow. It was a thing not known to <hi>Gregorie,</hi> for as I Travelled with him over the Mountains of <hi>Tirol,</hi> toward the end of <hi>September,</hi> ſeeing ſome Snow that had fallen a little before, crying out <hi>Haritz, Haritz,</hi> full of admiration, he called it Meal. From ſuch a temper of the Air it follows that the Country muſt needs be healthy; and conſequently the Inhabitants ſane and vivacious, inſomuch that ſome of them live to a hundred years of Age. Onely in <hi>Tigra,</hi> toward the beginning of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Spring, that is to ſay, in the Months of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> Feavers are very riſe.</p>
                  <p>However this variety of the Air is the cauſe of moſt dreadful Thunders. Which when <hi>Gregory</hi> deſcrib'd, he aſtoniſh'd his hearers. For upon the riſing of ſeveral Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts altogether, the Skie is of a ſudden cover'd over with black and thick as it were Globes of ſmokie Clouds; by and by the Thunder breaks forth on every ſide, ratling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, with Lightning as inceſſantly flaſhing, enough to amaze the moſt reſolute and moſt accuſtom'd to the noiſe. Their Rains are very violent, powering from the Clouds not by drops, but as it were in ſtreams. With thoſe the torrents being ſwell'd, rowle along with that rapid fury, that they carry Trees and Stones and all things before 'em. All their Rivers overflow; and then the high ways being either covered with water, or elſe all mirie and dirtie, 'tis a moſt tedious thing to Travel: And this enduring three Months together renders their Winters very unpleaſant. <hi>Gregory</hi> deſcrib'd the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Winter to me in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Winters are not caus'd onely by the Rain which falls from the Skie; for the Earth alſo opens her mouth, and vomits up water. There is a Fountain in every man's houſe, if it ſtands low. And therefore we never Build in low places, but in high grounds: So many and ſo great Rivers, and Springs of water out of the Earth; and ſuch violent Rains are no where the like to be ſeen as in our Country.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This tempeſtuous weather is ſo troubleſome and tedious to Forraigners, that in a diſpute which happen'd between an <hi>Aboſſine</hi> and an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> about the excellency of their Countries, when the firſt vaunted to the latter, the natural fertilitie of <hi>Abeſſinia,</hi> the temperateneſs of the Air, their double Harveſts, and other benefits of the Country, adding
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59633:18"/>
withall, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> cannot live without the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in regard that <hi>Nilus</hi> fatten'd <hi>Egypt</hi> with the Mud of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> without which, both Man and Beaſt would pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of Suſtenance; the <hi>Egyptian</hi> retorted upon the <hi>Abyſſinian,</hi> upbraiding him with the prodigious Showers, the rapid Torrents, the ſteep and rugged Mountains, and the dreadful Thunders that render'd the Country ſo unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; upon which the Victory was allow'd on his ſide.</p>
                  <p>Nor does the ſeaſon of the Winter keep the ſame Months, nor the ſame Temperature in all places alike, tho the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be the ſame; for it is not only milder in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſharper in others, but alſo in different Months from our Climate. Which was of old obſerv'd by<note n="(p)" place="bottom">In the Hiſtory of his Embaſſy, ſome Collections out of which are to be ſeen in <hi>Bibliothec. Photii. n. 3. p.m. 2.</hi>

From <hi>Aüe</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Axuma,</hi> the Winter is very rigorous, <hi>&amp;c. Gregory</hi> told me, That the Coaſt of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and all that two days Journey, from the Shore to the Mountains of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> the Winter keeps its Station in <hi>November, December,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> as in <hi>Europe;</hi> but they differ nothing in the Degrees of Latitude. So that it is not always true what ſome<note n="(q)" place="bottom">See the Notes upon <hi>Cluverius</hi>'s Introduction to Geography, <hi>l. 1. c. 5.</hi> and <hi>Ariſtot. l. 2. de Meteorologic.</hi> who without experience writes, That the Heat and Cold do not exceed in regard of the Longitude, but in regard of the Latitude.</note> Geographers have written, That the <hi>Perioeci,</hi> or thoſe that dwell under the ſame Meridian, have the ſame Winter and Summer.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Winter of that Coaſt is, you may eaſily gueſs, from the anſwer of <hi>Gregory,</hi> who being ask'd upon a very ſultry day, whether it were not very hot in <hi>Germany,</hi> made anſwer,</p>
                  <p>To day has been ſomething hot: Such is the Winter in <hi>Suaqena,</hi> which is an Iſland upon that Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>Being ask'd concerning the Seaſons of the Year, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59633:19"/>The Seaſon <hi>Matzau,</hi> the Seaſon of Flowers or the Spring.</p>
                  <p>The Seaſon <hi>Tzadai,</hi> the Seaſon of Harveſt or <hi>Autumn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Seaſon <hi>Hagai,</hi> or the Summer.</p>
                  <p>The Seaſon <hi>Crampt,</hi> or Winter.</p>
                  <p>Thus he reckon'd the four Seaſons: But there is not the ſame reaſon for them, nor the ſame benefits by them, as with us; nor could <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf reconcile them with ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matzau</hi> indeed may deſervedly be call'd the Spring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſucceeds the Winter, and covers the Fields with Graſs and Flowers. It begins upon a certain day of the Month, that is, upon the 25th of <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Tzadai</hi> of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> cannot be call'd properly <hi>Autumn,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> imagin'd; for it is the ſecond part of the year that ſucceeds the Spring, and exhilarates the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with ripen'd Fruits, and therefore ought more truly to be call'd <hi>Summer.</hi> But how <hi>Hagai</hi> is to be interpreted, is a queſtion; it is the third part of the year, yet cannot juſtly be call'd <hi>Autumn,</hi> in regard the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> are ignorant of any benefit they receive by it: They get no Vintage in, but are parch'd with extremity of Heat, and therefore they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this hotteſt time of the year to the ſharpeſt Cold of Winter.</p>
                  <p>For which reaſon we rather ought to conclude, that there are but three Seaſons among the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> that is to ſay, the Spring which begins upon the 25th of <hi>September.</hi> Then the Summer, which may be divided into two parts; the firſt, and the beſt, call'd <hi>Tzadai,</hi> which begins upon the 25th of <hi>December;</hi> and the laſt, and worſt part, call'd <hi>Hagai,</hi> which begins upon the 25th of <hi>June,</hi> and ends upon the<note n="(r)" place="bottom">

                  <p>The Days and Nights in that Climate, being in a right Sphere, are, for the moſt part, always equal. Their Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Evenings much ſhorter than ours. <hi>Gregory</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that it ſhould be light when he could not ſee the Sun; and again, after Sun-ſet, that the Twilight ſhould laſt ſo long.

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59633:19"/>The Winds, upon the Mountains frequent and pleaſant, render the Air healthful and temperate; but in open and flat Levels, the Air, for want of motion, grows hot and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom, eſpecially in the Iſlands of the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> This a certain Merchant atteſted, who carrying ſeveral rich <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities from the Port of <hi>Suaqena</hi> to the Court, and being ask'd by one of the King's Daughters, <hi>What there was that could not be purchas'd at the Port of</hi> Suaqena, anſwer'd, <hi>The Wind;</hi> that being only wanting in that place, otherwiſe a happy and pleaſant Iſland.</p>
                  <p>But all Winds are not equally grateful or beneficial in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> for there are ſome which are moſt impetuouſly violent; among the reſt, the Whirlwind, called <hi>Sendo,</hi> which in the <hi>Amharic</hi> Dialect ſignifies a <hi>Snake,</hi> a Wind ſo furious, that it throws down all before it, Houſes, Oaks, and Stones, and hurries them along in the Air. The <hi>Belgioms</hi> call this Wind <hi>Hoof,</hi> and report it frequent upon the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as they ſometimes experience to the loſs of their Ships. The Whirlwind by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> called <hi>Typhon,</hi> is that of which <hi>Pliny</hi> thus writes: <q rend="margQuotes">A principal Plague to the Mariners, which not only throws down the Maſts, but rives the Ship in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</q> And again, <q rend="margQuotes">The ſame Wind meeting oppoſition, carries all before it, and ſweeps whate're it meets into the Air.</q>

                  <p>A Region ſo Mountainous, and ſo like to <hi>Switzerland,</hi> may be look'd upon juſtly by all people as a moſt rude and unhuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded Country; but they that conſider the benefits which the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> receive thereby, will from the ſame reaſons be drawn to an admiring Contemplation of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: For that ſtupendious height of their Mountains con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns the ſcorching heat; which renders their Country the more inhabitable in thoſe high places, where the people breath a more ſerene Air. In the next place, Heaven has thereby provided for their ſecurity, ſo many inacceſſible Mountains, being like ſo many Caſtles, which afford them not only Habitation, but a ſafe defence againſt their Enemies. For had it not been for thoſe Fortreſſes of Nature, they had been ruin'd long e're this, by the <hi>Adelenſes</hi> and the <hi>Gallans.</hi> Moreover, thorough all thoſe Mountains you ſhall find moſt pleaſant Springs of Water, which are wanting in the Levels of the torrid Zone: The reaſon of which, we ſhall give you in another place.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abaſſia</hi> abounds in Metals and Minerals, eſpecially Gold, which is found in the Sand of the Rivers; and in <hi>Damota</hi> and <hi>Enarrea</hi> upon the Superficies of the Earth. Silver they have not, and yet not without Lead. They neither know, nor care to know, what belongs to Metals. Salt plentifully digg'd out of the Earth. Gems they want. They more eſteem black Lead, with which they colour their Eye-brows.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat ſo many and ſo vaſt Mountains afford plenty of Metals and Minerals, the Fathers of the Society atteſt. And certainly, 'tis a thing eaſily credible, that that part of the Earth, lying under the fierceſt and moſt maturing heat of the Sun, cannot be without Metals, and more eſpecially Gold, which is found in the ſhallows of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59633:21"/>
poliſh'd and pure in great quantities, about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Tare or Vetch. Whence it is conjectur'd, that the Gold is brought to perfection in the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and carry'd away together with the Sand, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Stream. <hi>Pliny</hi> affirms that ſort of Gold to be the fineſt and moſt perfect. <hi>Damota,</hi> but more eſpecially <hi>Enar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> enjoy this advantage, it being the chiefeſt Tribute which they pay. They are deſtitute of Silver; whether it be that Nature denies them that benefit, or that they know not how to dig it out and refine it: For they have Lead, which is ſaid to be the Mother of Silver.</p>
                  <p>But they are altogether ignorant of the Minery Trade. For the digging of Wells, boaring of Mountains, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Mines with maſſy Timber, hewing of Stones, or forcing Rocks with Gunpowder or Fire, to live in the dark, ſometimes hours, ſometimes days together, and to be half ſtrangled with Smoke and Damps, to<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Thus <hi>Pliny</hi> diſcourſes concerning Minerals.</note> ſearch the Vains of the Earth, and examin the Secrets of Rocks, are things altogether unſuitable to the Genius of the <hi>Habeſſines.</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they count it a piece of folly to pine after Minerals, and heap up Riches, to encourage the <hi>Turk</hi> to make War upon them. They think themſelves far more ſafe in Iron, as being that with which Gold may be won: And for Iron, they have no occaſion to delve for it, in regard they find it in great plenty upon the Superficies of the Earth, as <hi>P. Antonio Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez</hi> teſtifies.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in the Confines of <hi>Tigra</hi> and <hi>Angora,</hi> from a place call'd the <hi>Land of Salt,</hi> there<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Concerning ſuch kind of Salt, ſee <hi>Pliny,</hi> l. <hi>31.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> are natural Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Salt, from whence they ſupply themſelves with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible quantities, cutting it out of the ſides of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in great pieces of a white and ſolid Subſtance. In the Mountain it is ſoft, and ſliver'd off with little labour; but in the Air it hardens. From thence it is fetch'd by great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Merchants, who conveigh it away in Caravans, which are call'd <hi>Cafila,</hi> and vended through all the neighbouring Nations and Countries where it is a ſcarce Commodity. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus Mendez</hi> the Patriarch, writes, That there is in another place a Mountain of Red Salt, very uſeful in Phyſic. So propitiouſly has Heaven compenſated their want of Money
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59633:22"/>
with plenty of Salt; which by virtue whereof, as with ready Coyn, in other places they purchaſe other neceſſaries. Thus they abound in Salt, which the Life of Man cannot want; but they are deſtitute of other things that leſs conduce to the happineſs of Human Being. Nor do they deſire thoſe things, of whoſe dazling Beauties and glittering Colours they are ignorant; I mean Gems and Jewels, rarely yet ſeen in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> whatever that ſame Trifler, <hi>Valentinian</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. The Royal Diadem it ſelf glitters only with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Jewels, thinking it not worth their while to ſend their Salt or Gold to foreign and barbarous Nations to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe true ones; and admiring at our imprudence, for expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Money ſo idly. They much more eſteem thoſe Minerals, that conduce to the health and preſervation of the Body; chiefly among the reſt <hi>Stibium,</hi> or Black Lead, which they in their Language call<note n="(b)" place="bottom">A word well known in all the Eaſtern Languages, from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <argument>
                     <p>Many Rivers there more precious than Metals. The Fountains originally from Rain-water. An Encomium of <hi>Nilus:</hi> In Scripture it is call'd, The River <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Admiration caus'd the deſire of knowing its Original, that the Ancients plac'd in the Mountains of the Moon. The <hi>Portugals</hi> diſcover'd the true Fountains; their deſcription from <hi>Peter Pays,</hi> not different from <hi>Gregories:</hi> It riſes in <hi>Sicut;</hi> it has five Heads. It mixes with the Lake in <hi>Dembea.</hi> It paſſes by the principal Kingdoms of <hi>Habaſſia,</hi> encircles <hi>Gojam,</hi> runs through <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo into the Sea; <hi>Gregories</hi> Ethiopic Deſcription. He alledges, That all the Rivers of <hi>Africa</hi> fall into <hi>Nile.</hi> He limits that aſſertion. Some fall into the Sea. The true cauſes of the overflowing of <hi>Nile. Jovius</hi> blam'd.

                  </argument>
                  <p>BUT much more excelling, and far more precious Gifts of Nature than thoſe of Metals, flow from the Mountains of <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> that is to ſay, ſeveral remarkable Rivers more profitable to the Natives, and the neighbouring Nations, than Gold it ſelf, ſo much the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of human Avarice. For the Rain-water ſoaking through the pores of the Earth, and the clefts of the Rocks, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and, as it were, ciſtern'd up in the hidden Caverns of the Mountains, where, after it has paſs'd through many ſecret conveyances of Nature, at length it meets with ſome hollow place, and breaks forth. Sometimes oppreſs'd by its own weight, it reaſcends, and ſeeks for paſſage at the tops of the Mountains themſelves; which is the reaſon, that in Countries where there is little or no Rain, there are few or no Fountains; but where there are frequent Rains, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vers are large and ſwelling: The Effect demonſtrating the

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59633:24"/>
quaggy and merſhy; nevertheleſs the Water does not ſpring forth there, but iſſues from the foot of the Mountain. About a Muſquet Shot from thence, toward the Eaſt, the River begins to flow; then winding to the North, about the fourth part of a League, it receives another River; a little farther, two more flowing from the Eaſt fall into it; and ſoon after, it enlarges it ſelf with the addition of ſeveral other Streams. About a days journey farther, by the Relation of the ſame</hi> Peter, <hi>it ſwallows up the River</hi> Jema; <hi>then winding Weſtward ſome twenty Leagues, it turns again to the Eaſt, and plunges it ſelf into a vaſt Lake.</hi> This Relation differs not from what <hi>Gregory</hi> has diſcourſed to me, only he particulariz'd the names of the Countries, that perhaps were the more ſpecial Denominations of thoſe places, of which <hi>Sabala</hi> was the more general Name. For as he related to me, the Spring-head of <hi>Nile</hi> is in a certain Land call'd <hi>Secut,</hi> upon the top of <hi>Dengla,</hi> which perhaps is the name of a Mountain.

Having paſt the Limits of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hara, <hi>it waſhes the Confines of</hi> Walaka, <hi>and ſo on to the extream bounds of</hi> Mugara <hi>and</hi> Shewa. <hi>Then it ſlides between</hi> Bizama <hi>and</hi> Gonga, <hi>and deſcends into the Country of the</hi> Shankelites. <hi>Whence he winds to the right hand, and leaves by degrees the Weſtern Clime upon the left hand, to viſit the Kingdom of</hi> Sennar. <hi>But before he get thither, he meets with two great Rivers that plunge themſelves into his Streams, coming from the Eaſt; of which one is call'd</hi> Tacazè, <hi>that falls out of</hi> Tigra, <hi>and the other</hi> Guangue, <hi>that deſcends from</hi> Dembea. <hi>After he has taken a view of the Kingdom of</hi> Sennar, <hi>away he travels to the Country of</hi> Dengula, <hi>and ſo comes to the Kingdom of</hi> Nubia, <hi>and thence turns to the right hand, in order to his intended Voyage for</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and comes to a certain Country which is call'd</hi> Abrim, <hi>where the Stream is unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable by reaſon of the Cliffs and Rocks; after which, he enters</hi> Egypt. Sennar <hi>and</hi> Nubia <hi>are ſeated upon the ſhore of</hi> Nile, <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Weſt, ſo that they may drink of his Waters; beſides, that he guards their Eaſtern Limits, as far as he approaches near them. But our People and Travellers from</hi> Sennar, <hi>after they have croſs'd</hi> Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, <hi>quit the River</hi> Nile, <hi>leaving it upon the right hand toward the Eaſt, and ride through a Deſert of</hi> 15 <hi>days journey upon Camels, where neither Tree nor Water, but only Sand is to be ſeen; but then they meet with it again in the Country of</hi> Riffe, <hi>which is the</hi> Upper Egypt, <hi>where they either take Boat, or travel a foot in Company with the Stream.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>All great Rivers and ſmaller Torrents flow into</hi> Nile, <hi>excepting only two: The one is call'd</hi> Hanazo, <hi>which riſes in</hi> Hangota; <hi>and the other</hi> Hawaſh, <hi>which runs near</hi> Dawara <hi>and</hi> Fatagara.</p>
                  <p>But as if this had not been enough, he goes on with a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Explanation in another Epiſtle, as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But whereas I told you in a Deſcription of</hi> Nile, <hi>that all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>flow'd into it except two, I am not to be underſtood, as if I ſpoke of all</hi> Ethiopia. <hi>For thoſe Rivers that are upon the Borders of the Circuit of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>which are near the Ocean, they fall into the Sea, every one in their diſtinct Regions. Now the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries adjoyning to the Ocean, are theſe;</hi> Canbat, Guraghè, Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Zandera, Wed, Waci, Gaci, <hi>and ſome others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Native Country of <hi>Nile</hi> being thus diſcover'd, the cauſe of his Inundation is manifeſt: For moſt of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> when the Sun returns into the Winter Signs, are waſh'd, as we have ſaid, with immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Showers. So that the prodigious maſs of Waters that randevouzes from all parts, cannot be contain'd within his Channel, and therefore when it comes into the Levels of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it preſently disburthens it ſelf. Thoſe Northern Winds, from their Anniverſary Breezes, call'd <hi>Eteſiae,</hi> add little to the Increaſe. Tho ſome have written, That their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Sea againſt the Mouths of the River, drives back the Waters of <hi>Nile,</hi> and augments the cauſe of the Deluge. A thing not likely, in regard they are the moſt temperate of all the Winds, and blow only in the day-time. Thus far indeed they may prevail, as they blow ſlacker or ſtronger, to render the Increaſe ſomewhat the more unequal, and that is all. Vainly therefore did many believe, that the Snow that melted from the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Mountains, delug'd into the River <hi>Nilus;</hi> for them, that profound Tracer of Nature, <hi>Seneca,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And in this part of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>are the two</hi> Niles <hi>parted;</hi> that is, <hi>Nilus</hi> which waters out Country of <hi>Nubia,</hi> directs his Courſe from South to North, and moſt of the Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> are ſeated on each ſide of his Banks, and in his Iſlands. The other part of <hi>Nile</hi> flows from the Eaſt toward the Weſt, and upon this part of <hi>Nile</hi> lies the whole Country of the <hi>Nigrites,</hi> or at leaſt the greater part of it.</p>
                  <p>A little after he adds concerning a certain Mountain; <hi>And near to that, one of the Arms of</hi> Nile <hi>turns off, and flows to the Weſt:</hi> And this is the <hi>Nile</hi> that belongs to the Country of the <hi>Nigrites,</hi> many of their Provinces lying upon it. But near the Eaſtern ſide of the Mountain, the other Arm turns off, waters the Country of <hi>Nubia,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and is divided in the <hi>Lower Egypt</hi> into four parts, of which three fall into the <hi>Syrian</hi> Sea, and the other empties it ſelf in a Salt Lake which is near to <hi>Alexandria</hi> The words are every way moſt clear; and very probable it is, That the ſeparation of the two <hi>Niles</hi> might be caus'd by the reſiſtance of ſome rocky Mountain that conſtrain'd the two Streams to part, ſince they could not undermine it.

left Channel. Nor am I a little confirm'd by the judgment of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which he expreſſed to me by writing, in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as to what is reported, that</hi> Nile <hi>does not flow altogether and entirely into the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>but that it is divided another way. This all thoſe perſons of whom I have enquir'd, averr to me to be truth. This I alſo encline to believe, for ſhould it deſcend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely thither in the Winter time, the</hi> Egyptians <hi>could never be ſafe in their Houſes.</hi> But as to what concerns its ſeparation, they ſay, That Parting happens after the River has paſs'd by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar</hi> in the Country of <hi>Dengula,</hi> before it arrives in <hi>Nubia:</hi> However, they ſay, That the greateſt maſs of Water flows into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that the ſeparated part runs directly to the weſtern Ocean; yet ſo, that it comes not into <hi>Barbary,</hi> but deſcends toward the Country of <hi>Elwah,</hi> and ſo throws it ſelf into the weſtern Ocean.</p>
                  <p>Now that the River <hi>Niger</hi> ſhould be the left Channel of <hi>Nile,</hi> is moſt probable from hence, for that as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, and Experience confirms,<note place="margin">

Neither does the Name it ſelf contradict the Conjecture, in regard that, as we have ſaid, <hi>Nilus</hi> it ſelf is by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd <hi>Niger.</hi> But as to what the <hi>Egyptian</hi> related to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> That the left Channel flow'd toward the South, that perhaps might be for ſuch a certain diſtance of Land, not but that afterwards it might vary its Courſe, and wind toward the Weſt. Which opinion, after I had communicated to the moſt famous <hi>Bochart,</hi> ſo highly skill'd both in the ancient and modern Geography, and the beſt Judge of theſe matters, he wrote me in anſwer, <hi>Il eſt tres vray, que le Niger eſt une partie du Nile; Moſt certain it is, that</hi> Niger <hi>is a part of</hi> Nile.</p>

Thereupon, in favour of the Patriarch, the King commanded the Channel to be open'd, through which the Water ran into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was then ſtopp'd up. Which being done, <hi>Nilus</hi> encreas'd three yards in one night, and the River was ſo fill'd, that the Fields of <hi>Egypt</hi> were water'd and ſown.

                  <p>I could wiſh to hear the opinions of thoſe that deny this place. The words are clear of themſelves, that the King commanded the Channel that was ſtopp'd to be open'd. The Hiſtorian himſelf is accounted a credible Author, bred and born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as alſo Secretary to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes of that Country. So that he could not poſſibly be ignorant of ſuch an accident; and beſides, he wrote his Hiſtory above a hundred and twenty years after the thing happen'd: And therefore had it been an untruth, he durſt not have mention'd it for fear of being contradicted, which he might eaſily have been. But it may be objected, That the Hiſtorian does not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59633:27"/>
mention by whom the Channel was obſtructed, or whether it happen'd, as many times it does, naturally, when the courſe of a Stream is damm'd up by trunks of Trees, Mud and Stones driven by force, and heap'd together in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſages of the Water. But this Objection does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the doubt; for ſuch remarkable ſtops rarely or never happen in ſuch large or violent Rivers. Or if Nature could effect ſo much, what might not be accompliſh'd by Art? <hi>Athanaſius Kircher,</hi> a perſon not only generally vers'd in the Affair of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but more particularly in what related to the River <hi>Nile,</hi> in his Catalogue of the Patriarchs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, That one<note n="(t)" place="bottom">In Supplement.

                     <hi>Michael</hi> was ſent into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Nile</hi> to its Channel, from whence the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had directed the Courſe of its Waters; tho it be the fault of that learned Man to write much, rather than accurately; nor does he always commend his Authors. The Queſtion being put to <hi>Gregory,</hi> he did not remember the Story of <hi>Michael,</hi> but that he had heard from perſons of great Credit, That not far from the Cataracts of <hi>Nile,</hi> all the Land toward the Eaſt lies level; and unleſs it were for one Mountain that ſtands in the way, <hi>Nile</hi> would rather flow that way, than into <hi>Egypt</hi> or the Northern Sea. So that if that Mountain were digg'd through, a thing to be done with pains and difficulty, the Courſe of the River might be turn'd and carry'd into the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi> which is well known to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and many of the <hi>Portugals:</hi> And for this reaſon have the Emperours of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> obtain'd thoſe advantagious Conditions from the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens.</hi> Nay, it is ſaid, That once one of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours had an intention to have done it, and had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Subjects to undertake the Work, but that he was prevail'd upon to deſiſt at the entreaty of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, this thing has very much perplex'd my thoughts; nor are the Reaſons that are brought againſt it to be contemn'd: For either to raiſe a Mole or Dam of Stones, and then to remove it again, are things requiring ſo much toyl and labour, that the Task does no way agree with the nature of the <hi>Abeſſines.</hi> And it ſeems ſomewhat unlikely, that ſo vaſt a River, ſo long accuſtom'd to a declining and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59633:27"/>
headlong Courſe, ſhould be diverted and compell'd to change its Channel. I conſider'd alſo with my ſelf, that if the King of <hi>Habeſſinia</hi> had the River <hi>Nile</hi> ſo much in his Power, he might have all <hi>Egypt</hi> eaſily at his Devotion, and that the <hi>Turk</hi> could deny him nothing whatever he demanded. Nor would he ever ſuffer the Chriſtians of his own Religion, and the Patriarch, who is the Head of his Church, to groan under ſuch a miſerable Bondage. Laſtly, I did not a little wonder, that the Jeſuits did not inſinuate it into the heads of the <hi>Abeſſines</hi> to make uſe of that Power which Nature had put into their hands, and that they did not uſe Threats, rather than Intreaties and Bribes to obtain thoſe convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which they enjoy by the favour of the <hi>Turkiſh Baſha,</hi> who commands the Ports of the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> But all things conſider'd, and rejecting the Hiſtory of <hi>Elmacine,</hi> we may anſwer <hi>Tellez</hi> from the Relation of <hi>Gregory,</hi> which is, That a new Channel may be carry'd on, not from thoſe parts of <hi>Abeſſinia,</hi> which lie upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> and are ſo many Leagues diſtant from the Sea; but from that part which is near the Cataracts, and formerly perhaps belong'd to <hi>Nubia.</hi> My firſt Opinion was, That the Channel of <hi>Nile</hi> could no where be ſo eaſily alter'd as in that place where it divides it ſelf into two Channels, for that there, by the direction of Nature her ſelf, it ſeem'd, that the whole might be more eaſily turn'd another way, where a part turns naturally without compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For tho other Rivers empty themſelves into <hi>Nile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this ſeparation, and flow into <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet are they not enough to make the Inundation ſo great as neceſſity requires; which would not only be the ruin of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Power. But however it be, this I believe to be certain, That the King of <hi>Habeſſinia</hi> is now no more Lord of thoſe places where the River <hi>Nile</hi> ever was, or ever can be diverted from <hi>Nile;</hi> nor are the Princes of thoſe places now at his Devotion; neither are they indeed <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but unhappily revolted to <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever formerly might have been done, cannot now be brought to paſs; not that the nature of the place obſtructs the deſign, but that the Prince of the Country wants Power, or elſe has no inclination to the Project. Otherwiſe I ſhould not think it either abſurd or improbable, that ſome Rivers that make their way through the high Fields of <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> might be convey'd another way by the deſcents of the Hill, through
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59633:28"/>
the ſandy Levels that lye below to a vaſt diminution of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Stream, provided that skilful Artiſts were employ'd to ſurvey the declivities of the places, and the places moſt proper to carry off the Water. For though it be a difficult thing to alter the Courſe and Limits of Rivers, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ſettl'd, yet Examples are not wanting. We read in <hi>Herodotus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>But there are other remarkable Rivers that owe for their Springs to <hi>Habeſſinia</hi> beſides <hi>Nilus.</hi> Of theſe the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous is <hi>Tacazè,</hi> which riſing in <hi>Angota,</hi> not far from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemdra,</hi> out of the Mountain <hi>Ahguaga,</hi> divides <hi>Tigra</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kajit,</hi> and ſo paſſing through the <hi>Ethiopian Nomades,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Dequin,</hi> at length falls into <hi>Nile.

                  <p>All theſe Rivers, as well as <hi>Nile,</hi> in the Winter time ſwell to that height, as not to be contain'd within their own Banks.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt we omit the admirable nature of two more Rivers, of which the one call'd <hi>Hawaſh,</hi> riſing in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Shewa</hi> and <hi>Wed,</hi> haſtens into the Kingdom of <hi>Adel,</hi> to quench the drought of thoſe thirſty Soyls. Nor are the Inhabitants wanting to themſelves; they gladly go to meet their welcom Gueſt, and bring it in ſeveral large Cuts to water their Grounds. And thus being frequently intercepted, and waſted by degrees, as if aſham'd to carry a ſmall portion of Water to the Sea, it plunges it ſelf into the Sand.

                  <p>Herbs of all ſorts grow in this Country, not only the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and medicinal Plants of <hi>Europe,</hi> but ſome more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and of admirable vertue. The <hi>Amadmagda</hi> cures broken and diſ-joynted Bones, contrary to the <hi>Oſſifraga</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> which ſnaps the Bones of Cattel that tread upon it. The Herb <hi>Aſſazoe</hi> is of that rare vertue againſt the biting of <hi>Aſps,</hi> that the moſt hurtful Serpents touch'd with this Herb, are ſtreight intoxicated, and lye for dead. He that eats of the Root of this Herb, may walk without danger in the midſt of Adders and Water-Snakes, and for many years ſhall be free from the fear of them: In ſo much, that ſome of the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> have been ſeen, after they have eaten of this Root, to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the moſt venomous Snakes like Eels, twiſt 'em about their Necks; and then to kill 'em, when they had done ſhewing tricks with 'em. So Providence ordering the moſt efficacious Remedies where the Poyſons are moſ pernicious. Which makes me believe that it was not a thing peculiar, or a particular faculty in the <hi>Pſylli,</hi> an ancient People of <hi>Africa,</hi> that they could cure the biting of Serpents, but got by the uſe of this Herb; only they kept the thing ſecret to render themſelves the more admired. For they made a Trade of it, by carrying Venemous Animals about the World without danger, for the ſight whereof, the more curious gave them Money. <hi>Garden Saffron,</hi> which the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> call <hi>Denguelet,</hi> is frequent in <hi>Habeſinia;</hi> the Seed of it <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhewed me for a great Rarity: and cryed up the Oyl which was to be preſſed out of it, againſt the <hi>Hypocondriacal Evil,</hi> and <hi>Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spleen.</hi> They want Hopps, and boyl their Drink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. And therefore <hi>Gregory</hi> finding, that it was the vertue of the Hopps, which kept our Drink ſo long, took great care to carry ſome of the Seed along with him into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Their Vine and Grapes are moſt Tranſcendant, but they never make any Wines, whether out of ignorance, or becauſe the Grapes being ripen'd in Summer, the exceſſive

heat haſtens the fermentation and ſowers the Liquor before the Lee be ſetled. They abound in Sugar, but as for Pepper, Ginger, and other ſuch like Spices they have none; rather out of careleſneſs to Plant, as I believe, than through the fault of the Soyl; which conſidering the variety of the Air, and the continual heat of ſome Places, ſeems moſt proper for ſuch a ſort of Husbandrie. The Indian Figg alſo, which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians</hi> call <hi>Muz</hi> or <hi>Mauz,</hi> grows plentifully here, a moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fruit it is; and you ſhall have fifty Figgs, about the bigneſs and ſhape of a Cucumber hanging upon one ſtalk, of a moſt delicious odour and taſte. They are ripe in <hi>June,</hi> as I learnt from the Itinerary of Prince <hi>Radzevile,</hi> who had ſeen ſome of them near <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where they are rare; for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a hotter Climate.

                     <hi>Dudaim</hi> mention'd in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which occaſion'd ſo much diſcontent between the two Wives of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Soon after I obſerv'd that many others, Learned Men, lighted upon the ſame Conjecture, though they do not give their Reaſons. For in my Opinion, it ſhould be ſome rare and pleaſant Fruit, that ſhould move the Boy to gather it; yet not ſo much a Boy neither, as to think it worth his while to carry home a ſtinking <hi>Mandrake,</hi> which could be a fruit little worth contending for. Beſides, <hi>Rachel</hi> might have ſent her Servant as well to have gathered Amiable Flowers, (as ſome render the Word) that is to ſay, Lillies, Violets, or the like. And beſides the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word ſeems to confirm this Opinion: as being in the <hi>dual</hi> Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſeeming to infer a relation of more than one Fruit to one and the ſame Stalk.</p>
                  <p>Apples and Pears, ſuch as grow in our Climates, they have none. For at what time they Ripen with us, Storms and Tempeſts rage in <hi>Habeſſinia.</hi> For the Trees, as I have heard the Habeſſines acknowledge, obſerve our Seaſons, ſprout forth and ſhed their Leaves in the ſame Month with ours; but with the Plants it is otherwiſe, which Flower there in our Winter. However, they have Pome-Citrons, Abricots, Peaches, and Pomegranates, rip'ned to their full and due Perfection. <hi>Gregory</hi> admired to behold our Woods of tall Firrs, ſome ſeventy, ſome eighty Foot high; and often call'd them <hi>Arbores benedictas,</hi> bleſſed Trees: eſpecially, when he heard how uſeful they were towards the building of Ships and Houſes. However we do not find but that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> has
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59633:33"/>
its ſhare of tall Trees, as well as other Countries. But the Tree which goes by the Name of <hi>Enſete,</hi> is not to be paſs'd over without Admiration; being like that which bears the Indian Figg, two fathoms in thickneſs. For being half cut down, it renews again by means of innumerable ſhouts that ſpring again from the remaining Trunk, all which is fit to be eaten; ſo that there is no need that the Tree ſhould bear any other Fruit, it being all Pot-herb of it ſelf. For being ſlic'd and boyl'd it aſſwages the Thirſt of the common ſort of People, who bruiſe the Leaves and boyl them with Meal, and then eat the Compoſition inſtead of a Haſtie-pudding. There is another Tree which <hi>Godignus</hi> praiſes, moſt excellent againſt the Worms in the Belly: a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per frequent among the <hi>Abeſſines,</hi> by reaſon of their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Raw Fleſh.

                     <hi>Africa</hi> was formerly Famous for the Heards and Droves of Cattle fed therein; and at this time there are ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſupport themſelves meerly by Grazing: of this ſort are the <hi>Bektences,</hi> not far from <hi>Suaquena,</hi> who in the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Inhabit the Mountains; in the <hi>Winter</hi> ſpread themſelves upon the Plains, changing their Seats as the Tempeſtuous Seaſons varie, and ſettling where they find moſt Fodder for their Cattel.</p>
                  <p>Their Horſes are courageous and ſtrong; but they never make uſe of them, unleſs it be in Battel, or when they run Races; ſo that they never take care to ſhooe them: for if at any time they cannot avoid paſſing through Stony and Rocky paſſages, they lead their Horſes, riding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Mules. They are of various Colours, as our Horſes are; bright Bay, Sorrel, cole Black, Roan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but moſt commonly Black. <hi>Elmacin</hi> reports, That <hi>Cyrtacus</hi> King of <hi>Nubia</hi> brought into <hi>Aegypt</hi> an Army of a Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Blacks,</hi> all mounted upon Black Horſes. <hi>Gregory</hi> piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Horſes, when he ſaw them drawing great Carts; admiring at the Patience of the Beaſts: and our Cruelty, in putting ſo Noble and Warlike a Creature to ſuch baſe and ſervile Exerciſes. And therefore the <hi>Abiſſines</hi> make more frequent uſe of Mules, as well to carry their burthens, as when they travel long Journeys; for no ſort of Beaſt treads more ſafely in their rugged ways: and for the greater eaſe of the Rider, they teach them ſometimes to Amble. It was very troubleſome to <hi>Gregory</hi> when he travell'd, to ride a Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; eſpecially, if the Horſe either Trotted or Gallopp'd: a vexation which he frequently complained of.</p>
                  <p>Camels are never uſed but in the plain Country, for they tread upon the Sand though ſcalding hot, without any harm to their Feet; but in Mountainous and Rocky ways, they are altogether uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>That ſame ſort of Sheep alſo, ſo much admired and ſo well known, both in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and in <hi>Africa,</hi> is here very common; the Tayls of which are ſo fat and ponderous, that the leaſt of them weigh Ten and Twelve, the biggeſt of

                  <p>But as for Wild Beaſts, <hi>Abiſſinia</hi> breeds more, and more bulkie than any other Region: of which, we ſhall give a ſhort account, beginning from thoſe which appear moſt Monſtrous in their Creation. In the firſt place <hi>Elephants,</hi> conſpicuous for bulk of Body and Docility, heard together in the Plain and Woody places in great Numbers. <hi>H. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowic Azevedez</hi> ſaw in <hi>Tigra</hi> a hundred of them together differing in Bigneſs; and he atteſts, that as great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber went but a little before them.<note n="(c)" place="bottom">This number may eaſily be believed by them who ſhall read <hi>Nennoſies</hi> in Bibliothec. <hi>Photii.</hi> n. <hi>3.</hi> Where he writes of <hi>Elephants,</hi> no ſmall Number near five thouſand.</note> But it is almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be told, what a havock they make in the Fields and Woods: they will ſhake Trees bigger then themſelves in Bulk, ſo long, till either their Trunks break, or the whole Tree be torn up by the Roots, as with an Earthquake. Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Trees they ſnap off about a hands breadth from the Ground. As for ſhrubs and underwoods, and all ſorts of fruit Trees, they either eat 'em up, or trample 'em under their feet. <hi>Gregory</hi> was wont to ſay, That they open'd <hi>High ways,</hi> and where they had gone before, Travellers would rather chooſe to follow, as being leſs cumberſom. But leaſt Food ſhould be wanting to ſuch Maſſie Creatures, Providence has provided: For in thoſe Places there grow certain Trees about the bigneſs of Cherry-Trees, full of Pith, like Elder; upon which they ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59633:37"/>
as upon Graſs. Of all the dumb Beaſts, this Creature certainly ſhares the moſt of Human Underſtanding: kind u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage excites their Ambition, contumely fires their Revenge. Of which many Examples are extant among the Writers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtorie. <hi>Gregory</hi> told us, that where they like their Entertainment, they are very punctual in obſerving the Laws of Hoſpitality; though one of the Females would have ſerv'd her Hoſt but an ugly trick after her departure from her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This Elephant had brought forth a Young one, in a certain Field which her Landlord had ſow'd with Corn; who willing to diſlodge ſuch an unwelcome Gueſt, had reſolv'd to kill the ſaid Elephant: his Neighbours diſſuaded him, aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that the ſlaughter would not be unreveng'd; but on the other ſide, that ſhe would defend his ripe Harveſt againſt all others, and therefore advis'd him to let her alone, till ſhe had brought up her Cubb; but withal, ſo ſoon as ſhe had done that, forthwith to reap his Harveſt. The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man following this Counſel, preſerv'd his Harveſt untouch'd, ſuffering no other Injury than what the Beaſt ſpoil'd in her paſſage to and fro. After the Female had carryed away her young ones from that Place, the Husbandman by the help of his Neighbours got in his Harveſt with all ſpeed. The next Night the Elephants came in Troops, with an intention to have Supp'd with their Landlord before their departure, but found the Table taken away, and the Buttery Empty. The People of the Country aver, that they are not their Teeth, but their Horns of which the Ivory is made; and indeed, their ſubſtance and ſituation demonſtrate the ſame thing: for they grow out of the Head and not out of the Jaws: and beſides that, they only adorn the brows of the Males; the Females like our Does have none at all. The Elephant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offers to attempt upon any perſon, unleſs provok'd; if he be threatn'd with ſticks or cudgels, he hides his <hi>Proboſces</hi> under his Belly, and goes away braying; for he is ſenſible it may be eaſily chop'd off: the extream parts of it being very nervous and tender, which cauſe him to be afraid of hard blows. At the end of it three little ſharp pointed Langets come forth, by the help of which, he can take up the ſmalleſt thing that is, as men do with their fingers. They never take care to tame them here, where there is no uſe of them, either in Peace or War, among ſo many high Mountains.</p>
                  <p>The next is, the <hi>Camelo-pardalis,</hi> or <hi>Panther-Camel,</hi> which is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59633:38"/>
and bulkie as the Elephant, but far exceeds him in tallneſs. For this Beaſt is ſo very high, that a man of a juſt Statue, reaches but up to his knees, ſo that it ſeems very credible what is reported, That a Man on horſeback ſitting upright on his ſaddle, may ride under his Belly. He derives his Name from hence, that he has a long Head, and a long Neck like a Camel, but a Skin ſpotted all over like a Panther. The <hi>Romans,</hi> when they firſt beheld this Beaſt, called it a <hi>Wild-Sheep,</hi> tho being more remarkable for its Aſpect, then its Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Fierceneſs; as we read in <hi>Pliny.</hi> By the <hi>Abiſſines,</hi> by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of his Tayl, he is call'd <hi>Jerataka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ein;</hi> that is, <hi>ſlender Tayl:</hi> by the Italians <hi>Giraffa:</hi> from the Arabian word <hi>Zucaffa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is a Beaſt which is called <hi>Zecora,</hi> which for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exceeds all the Four-footed Creatures in the World. They of <hi>Congo</hi> give it the Name of <hi>Zebra.</hi> This Creature is about the bigneſs of a Mule, and is brought out of the Woods of <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> and the Countries poſſeſſed by the <hi>Galans,</hi> and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tam'd. A preſent of great eſteem and frequently given to the Kings of <hi>Habeſſinia. Tellez</hi> briefly deſcribes him thus, <hi>A Circle of a black Colour encompaſſes his Loyns like a girdle; adjoyning to which, Nature has pencill'd out ſeveral others, ſome broader ſome narrower, ſome black, and ſome of a bright ſhining Aſh-Colour; with ſo much Elegancy and Order, as no Painters Art can equalize. His Eares are the only thing that disfigures him; being of a disproportionable length: for which reaſon he is called by the</hi> Portugals <hi>Burro do Matto, (though improperly) the wild Aſs.</hi> But you may gueſs at his beauty, by his price. For King <hi>Suſneus</hi> having given one of theſe Beaſts to the Turkiſh <hi>Baſha</hi> of <hi>Suaqena,</hi> he ſold the ſame for Two thouſand <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Pieces, to a certain <hi>Indian,</hi> that bought him for a Preſent to the great <hi>Mogul.</hi>

                        <hi>Panthers</hi> and <hi>Tygers</hi> are the only Beaſts remarkable for the variety of their Spots, ſaith <hi>Pliny,</hi> L. <hi>8. c. 17.</hi> In which place, the <hi>Panther</hi> is taken for the <hi>Leopard;</hi> but when the <hi>Panther</hi> is oppos'd to the <hi>Leopard,</hi> then it is to be taken for the <hi>Tygre.</hi> For the Antients have not accurately enough diſtinguiſhed theſe Beaſts, as being very much like to one another, and very rarely or never ſeen together.

                  </p>
                  <p>As for their <hi>Wolves,</hi> they are ſmall and lazie, ſuch as <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> bred in former times, as <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifies:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Of <hi>Apes</hi> there are infinite Flocks up and down in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains themſelves, a thouſand and more together: there they leave no ſtone unturn'd. If they meet with one that two or three cannot lift, they call for more Ayd, and all for the ſake of the Worms that lye under; a ſort of Dyet which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh exceedingly. They are very greedy after <hi>Emmets.</hi> So that having found an Emmet-hill, they preſently ſurround it, and laying their fore Paws with the hollow downward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the Ant-heap, as faſt as the Emmets creep into their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Palmes, they lick 'em off with great comfort to their Stomachs: and there they will lie till there is not an Emmet left. They are alſo pernicious to fruit and Apples, and will deſtroy whole Fields and Gardens, unleſs they be carefully look'd after. For they are very cunning, and will never venture in till the return of their Spies, which they ſend always before; who giving Information, that all things are ſafe, in they ruſh with their whole Body, and make a quick diſpatch. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go very quiet and ſilent to their Prey; and if their young ones chance to make a noiſe, they chaſtiſe them with their fiſts, but if they find the Coaſt clear, then every one hath a different noiſe to expreſs his joy. Nor could there be any way to hinder them from further Multiplying, but that they fall ſometimes into the ruder hands of the wild Beaſts, which they have no way to avoid, but by a timely flight, or creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the clefts of the Rocks. If they find no ſafety in flight, they make a vertue of neceſſity, ſtand their ground, and filling their Paws full of Duſt or Sand, fling it full in the Eyes of their Aſſailant, and then to their Heels again.</p>
                  <p>But there is another ſort of Creature very harmleſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſportive, call'd in the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Language <hi>Fonkes,</hi> in the <hi>Amharc</hi> Dialect <hi>Guereza,</hi> (which is a kind of <hi>Marmoſet</hi>) and in <hi>Latine Cercopitheculus.</hi> Of which the following Rhime is common in ſeveral parts of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>

                     </gap> or <hi>Cygnus</hi> in Latine, which perhaps they had heard by report was bigger than all other Birds: this Fowl has a great antipathy againſt Doggs, which ſhe eagerly purſues though with hazard of her Life. I had a young one ſent me out of <hi>India</hi> which was kill'd by a Maſtive; but the Skin I ſtill preſerve. The Fleſh of the Fowl whether new or ſmoak'd is made uſe of in Remedies againſt the biting of Serpents, which was found out by obſerving how eagerly they devour them without harm. But Providence has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided one ſingle Enemy to their Serpents only. For the Egyptian <hi>Ibis,</hi> and the <hi>Ophiomachus,</hi> from his continual Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thoſe Vermine, call'd in the <hi>Amharic Dialect,</hi> the <hi>Serpent devourer,</hi> make great havock of thoſe Venemous Creatures. So that <hi>Africa,</hi> though it breed moſt pernicious Animals, yet it affords moſt excellent Remedies againſt thoſe Miſchiefs.

And indeed, ſome of thoſe Birds ſeem to be granted to Man for the Extirpating the Enemies of their well being, which becauſe they cannot vanquiſh themſelves, they betray to them that they think more able. For there is a little Bird, by thoſe of <hi>Tygra</hi> call'd from the Noiſe which it makes <hi>Pipi,</hi> which, ſtrange to tell will, lead the Hunters to the Places where the Wild Beaſts lye hid: never leaving their Note of <hi>Pipi,</hi> till the Hunters follow them, and kill the diſcover'd Prey. <hi>Gregory</hi> related to me, <hi>That as he was walking with one of his acquaintance, an Inhabitant of</hi> Tygra; <hi>this Bird cry'd</hi> Pipi <hi>over their heads; thereupon, underſtanding the meaning of it from his Friend, he reſolv'd to try the Truth of the Story. The Bird conducted them to a ſhady Tree, about the boughs of which, a Monſtrous huge Snake had Curl'd her ſelf; at the ſight whereof, he and his friend made more haſt back again, than they did coming to ſatisfie their Curioſity.</hi> And indeed, it is not ſafe to follow this Bird, unleſs a man be provided with all his Hunting Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: nevertheleſs, the Bird has her own ends in her dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence too: for ſhe is ſure to have her ſhare of the Slaughtered Carcaſe whate're it be. Nor is this Bird to be found only in <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Guiny</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Quoja,</hi> where they give it the Name of <hi>Fonton,</hi> being about the bigneſs of a Larke, where it is reported to betray not only wild Beaſts, but alſo Serpents and Bees.</p>
                  <p>They have no tame <hi>Geeſe:</hi> and therefore <hi>Gregory</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Flock of <hi>Geeſe</hi> once driven along by their Keeper; <hi>pleaſantly demanded of me, Whether thoſe Birds were obedient to their Keeper?</hi> to whom, when I reply'd <hi>yes;</hi> he asked me a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Whether if they flew, the Keeper flew too, and Whether before or behind? but when I told him what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Birds they were, he extoll'd them for bleſſed Feather-bearing birds; eſpecially, when he had layn upon their ſoft Down at the Caſtle of <hi>Gota:</hi> for he had never layn upon a Feather-bed before he came into <hi>Germany:</hi> So that he thought that the <hi>German</hi> beds ſwelling with light Down, had been blown up with the Wind. But he Admir'd that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were Arriv'd at that height of delicacy, that Men ſhould ſtoop to ſo much Effeminacy as to lay themſelves, where it was only fit for Children, and Women in Child-bed to lye. For he did not believe they would eaſily take the Field, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their ſoft beds followed them.

I have nothing to relate worth Remark. By the way, I have this further to add, That there are neither <hi>Eagles</hi> nor <hi>Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows</hi> in all theſe Parts; and therefore they tell Stories and Fables of their bigneſs and ſtrength: ſuch as the <hi>Arabs</hi> recount of their<note n="(y)" place="bottom">Of which <hi>Bochartus</hi> in <hi>Hieroz.</hi> L. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>

                  <p>FRom hence we paſs to another ſort of Creatures, miſchievous to Men and Beaſts, of which there are divers kinds. In the firſt place, <hi>Dragons</hi> of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſize are in <hi>Habeſſinia</hi> to be found; miſchievous, only in their voracity, but not at all Venomous; Nature provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they ſhould not be doubly hurtful to men.

                     <note n="(d)" place="bottom">This circumſtance induced me to believe, that <hi>Gregory</hi> meant the Serpents call'd <hi>Hydrus</hi> and <hi>Cherſydrus,</hi> or <hi>Land-water-Snake,</hi> by reaſon that Authors allow them a venemous noyſom breath. <hi>Virg.</hi> L. <hi>3.

Other ſorts of Serpents commonly and generally known I forbear to mention. The vulgar ſort of People contemn 'em, walk among 'em, and kill 'em at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Therefore as often as they go into the Country, they carry with them a croked ſtick; for being ſtreight, it hits only with the Point; but being bent like a Bow, it ſtrikes with greater force and certainty. <hi>Gregory</hi> hearing there were a great many Serpents about <hi>Helburgh</hi> in <hi>Franconia,</hi> belonging
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59633:50"/>
to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> provided himſelf with ſuch a ſort of Weapon, and when he met a Snake, never ſtruck it upon the head, but upon the middle of the back; by which means, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſabled the Serpent from creeping any further, he eaſily kill'd it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe parts of <hi>Africa</hi> which are moſt ſubject to heat, are moſt Infeſted with <hi>Serpents;</hi> which being for the ſame reaſon uncultivated, are therefore impaſſable. And therefore <hi>Gregory</hi> ſeeing our Boots, ſaid they were excellent defences againſt the Biting of <hi>Serpents.</hi> Sometimes they drive their Cattle, as I am apt to believe, fortified before-hand, by feeding upon the Plant <hi>Aſſazoe,</hi> into the Fields and places that are ſtrew'd with <hi>Serpents</hi> Eggs, on purpoſe that they ſhould trample 'em to pieces with their Hoofs: otherwiſe, they are ſo Fruitful that they would encreaſe beyond Imagination.</p>
                  <p>But much more pernicious than theſe are the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> which do not frequent the Deſert and Sandy places like the <hi>Serpents;</hi> but places beſt Manur'd, and Orchards moſt laden with Fruit. They appear in Prodigious Multitudes, like a thick Cloud that obſcures the Sun: nor Plants, nor Shrubs, nor Trees remain untouch'd: and whereſoever they feed, their leavings ſeem as it were parch'd with the Fire. Sometimes they enter the very Bark of the Trees, and then the Spring it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repair the Damage. A general Mortality enſues, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions lye waſt for many years; in regard the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> never take care<note n="(e)" place="bottom">

Indeed, for ſome time they may ſupport themſelves by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Locuſts</hi> themſelves, which they greedily eat, as well to ſatisfie their hunger as in Revenge; for it is a very ſweet and wholeſom ſort of Dyet: by means of which, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Portuguez</hi> Garriſon in <hi>India,</hi> that was ready to yield for want of Proviſion, held out till it was Relieved another way. And therefore it is not to be doubted, but that St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> fed upon theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning other Inſects, of which that Climate is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently fruitful, it will be needleſs to ſay much more; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to their <hi>Bees,</hi> we have this to obſerve; That they ſwarm in <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> and produce Prodigious quantities of Honey: They are a ſmall ſort of black Earthing-<hi>Bee,</hi> which make
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59633:51"/>
the whiteſt and the ſweeteſt Honey that is uſed in Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. From their Labours the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> gather their wild Honey, of the ſame nature with that which fed <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt;</hi> but in regard they want Stings, they ſeek for ſecurity in concealment; for they build their Architecture under Ground, into which the entrance is ſo narrow, that upon the ſight of a man, five or ſix of them will fill it, and place their little heads equal with the ground ſo like Artiſts, as to delude the quickeſt ſight.</p>
                  <p>Next to theſe their <hi>Ants</hi> or <hi>Emmets</hi> are very remarkable; of which, there are likewiſe ſeveral ſorts, not ſo bigg as a ſmall Dogg,<note n="(f)" place="bottom">This I rather believe, than the ſtory of <hi>Plinie,</hi> L. <hi>11. 9. 30.</hi> concerning <hi>Emmets</hi> among the Northern <hi>Indians,</hi> that dig up great pieces of Gold; themſelves as big as <hi>Egyptian Foxes.

Among the reſt, the moſt obſervable are thoſe which they call <hi>Gundan,</hi> for they always march in a kind of Military Array, obſerving Order and Diſcipline, leaving a kind of High-way behind them. They do not gather with induſtry, but preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and the pricks of their Stings are not a little painful. The next to theſe, are thoſe which by the Inhabitants are call'd, the <hi>Gundan</hi>'s Servants, being as it were Slaves to the Greater ſort; they march in Order, but carry their Proviſion in the nippers of their little Snowts, and lay it up; when it is moiſt they bring it forth again and dry it in the Sun: of theſe, by reaſon of their great Induſtry, it is thought, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake. There are ſome that have Wings at certain ſeaſons, with which they can Fly; which happens ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>Germanie:</hi> once I ſaw ſuch in my own Country; and theſe flying <hi>Ants,</hi> I remember, were eaſily devoured by the Poultrie.</p>

                  <p>HAving thus given an account of the Beaſts, Inſects, and Fiſh, peculiar to theſe Regions, we are now to ſpeak of the Inhabitants; Man being the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all the Creation, and for whoſe benefit the reſt were deſigned.

                  <p>
                     <hi>All the</hi> Habeſſines, (ſaith he) <hi>are endu'd with a pregnant Wit, and goodneſs of Diſpoſition; not Cruel, nor Bloody: they eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Injuries; there are few Quarrels among them, or if any do ariſe, they are ſeldom determin'd by the Sword; only Boxing and Cuffing decides the difference: They are Naturally given to Juſtice and Equity; ſo that having Cufft a while, they preſently chooſe Arbitrators, or repair to the Lord of the Place, and there ſet forth their Complaint in Words, without any of our Parchment Ambiguities, and hearing the Sentence which he gives, ſubmit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay or tergiverſation: So that they have no need of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers and Replies, and Rejoynders, and Exceptions; but avoid the noiſe of the Bar, and the expences of Pleading.</hi>

                  <p>And when he inveighs againſt <hi>Adamas—Saghed,</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Habeſſines,</hi> he adds, <hi>That he had forgot the Lenity, Truth,

                  <p>But before all the reſt he prefers thoſe of <hi>Enarea</hi> by the Confeſſion of the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> themſelves. For<note n="(g)" place="bottom">For thoſe are his words, L. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>30.</hi> pag. <hi>177. a.</hi>
                     </note> thoſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends above all others, both for their Endowments as well of Body as Mind; and for their Courage and Fidelity. A Teſtimony which certainly contains a very high Applauſe of a Nation, otherwiſe rude and impoliſh'd; ſo that if they had but the advantages of Education, moſt certain it is, that the <hi>Abeſſines,</hi> would prove the moſt ingenious and underſtanding people of all <hi>Africa;</hi> which is well known all over the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> And therefore Servants out of this Nation, are ſold for more, and more eſteem'd than Slaves out of any other of the Black Nations whatever. For which cauſe ſome Learned Men are of Opinion, that the King of the <hi>Abiſſines</hi> was therefore call'd <hi>Preſter-Chan,</hi> for that in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language <hi>Preſter-Chan</hi> ſignifies<note n="(h)" place="bottom">

They are moſt Covetous after Learning, and deſirous of the knowledg of Arts and Sciences. Nor was there any other greater reaſon of that kindneſs which was ſhewed to the Fathers of the Society to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the beginning of this Century, in <hi>Habesſinia,</hi> but that they were skilled in all ſorts of Arts and Sciences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admir'd by the King and Princes of the Nation. For they love and reverence all ſorts of Forrain Chriſtians that are adorn'd with the Ornaments of Art and Learning. <hi>Gregory</hi> related to me, That when the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Patriarch carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great number of very fair Books, ſundry of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and among the reſt, <hi>Tine,</hi> one of the King's Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, expreſſed himſelf with a Sigh in theſe words. <hi>Oh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py he that can underſtand all theſe Books!</hi> And many perſons of full years, hearing of the excellency and large uſe of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59633:52"/>
Latine Language, have moſt Ardently deſired to learn it. And that indeed ſeemed to me to be the moſt prevailing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why our <hi>Gregory</hi> though ſtricken in years, undertook ſo long a journey after me into <hi>Germany;</hi> and why <hi>Acalex</hi> a young <hi>Habeſſine</hi> followed him ſoon after; though not being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in <hi>Germany</hi> where he pronounced <hi>Ehrfaher</hi> inſtead of <hi>Erfurt</hi> he had the ill fortune to loſe his labour. Therefore they neither want ingenuity nor induſtry, but only Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Aſſiſtance, for they never travel long Journies: our <hi>Europeans</hi> are hindred by the difficulties of getting into their Country, and the tediouſneſs of the Journey, whether by Land or Sea: and beſides all this the Envy of the <hi>Turks</hi> joyn'd to their implacable Avarice will not permit them to ſuffer us to Import our Arts of Peace and War, to their own and the diſadvantage of the reſt of the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> Laſtly, their continual Civil Broyls, and Forraign Wars with the <hi>Gallans</hi> are ſuch as will not allow the Nobility leiſure to mind the Studies of Tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>But among ſuch a variety of people, it is impoſſible, that the ſame manners and diſpoſitions ſhould be in all; for Nature has brought forth nothing ſo good in the Univerſe, which has not ſomething of Evil mix'd with it.

                  <p>AMong ſo many and ſuch variety of Nations, it is no wonder there ſhould be ſuch diverſity of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.

Though it be true, that ſince their Kings left <hi>Axuma,</hi> the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this Country is very much alter'd; yet ſtill it approaches neareſt to the Ancient Language, which is as we but lately ſaid, now call'd the <hi>Ethiopic:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Abiſſines</hi> themſelves if they meet any doubtful word in this Language, preſently conſult thoſe of <hi>Tygra,</hi> concerning the ſignification.</p>

                     <hi>John Potken,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> of <hi>Cologne,</hi> now Ancient and Gray, was the firſt that divulg'd this Language in <hi>Europe;</hi> and then ſetting up a neat <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Printing-Houſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> there Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed the firſt <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Books, that is to ſay, the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> with the <hi>Hymns of the Old Teſtament,</hi> and the <hi>Canticles.</hi> In this deceiv'd that he gave too much Credit to certain Idle <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,</hi> who Affirm'd, That as well their Language, as their <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Characters were<note n="(o)" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Chaldaic.</hi> I could not find out the Cauſe of ſo Groſs an Errour; neither had <hi>Gregory</hi> ever heard it in his own Country: perhaps it fell out by reaſon of the likeneſs of the Language, though indeed it agree with the <hi>Chaldaic</hi> no more than with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriac;</hi> for it approaches neareſt to the <hi>Arabic,</hi> of which it ſeems to be a kind of Production; as being comprehended almoſt within the ſame <hi>Grammatical Rules;</hi> the ſame forms of Conjugations; the ſame forms of Plurals, both entire and anomalous; ſo that whoever underſtands either that, or the reſt of the <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Languages,</hi> may with little labour underſtand this our <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opic.</hi> Neither is it uſeful alone for the underſtanding of the <hi>Habeſſine</hi> Books and Affairs, but for Illuſtrating and Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of the <hi>Eaſtern Languages,</hi> and firſt the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> of which there is yet a ſmall remainder in the Bible; inſomuch that the genuine ſignifications of many words are to be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the neighbouring <hi>Dialects:</hi> and many texts of Sacred Writ borrow that Light from hence; as ſhall be more amply demonſtrated by Examples in our Commentary.

                  <p>But <hi>Axuma</hi> being relinquiſh'd, and the <hi>Empire</hi> being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the Heart of the Kingdom, the Vulgar uſe of this our Language ceas'd. For the <hi>Zagean</hi> Line failing, when they ſet up a <hi>Sewan</hi> Prince, where the <hi>Amharic Dialect</hi> is vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, and that ſome others who were Exiles in the Rock of <hi>Amhara,</hi> were call'd to the Government, the <hi>Amharic Dialect</hi> came into requeſt. For the new King not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Language of <hi>Tygra,</hi> and having advanc'd about his Perſon his own Friends that ſpake the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with him, brought his own <hi>Dialect</hi> into the Court and Camp; which being long fix'd there, and in the Parts adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59633:56"/>
was ſeldom remov'd into <hi>Tygra.</hi> In imitation of whom, the reſt of the Nobility and great Perſonages uſed the ſame Speech. Thus the <hi>Amharic Dialect,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Language,</hi> being carry'd along with the Camp and Court over all the Kingdom, <hi>(t)</hi> got the upper hand of all the other Dialects, and the Ancient and more Noble <hi>Ethiopic Language</hi> it ſelf: and at length became ſo Familiar to all the Chief of the <hi>Abiſſines,</hi> that you may eaſily by the uſe of that one Dialect Travel the whole <hi>Empire,</hi> though in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts ſo extreamly differing in Dialect from one another. It differs from the <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> both in Conſtruction and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſo that he who underſtands the one, cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the other; yet he who underſtands the one, may eaſily learn the other, becauſe that for above half the Language, as far as I can judge, the words are common to both. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> could hardly be perſwaded to Tranſlate me the Lords Prayer, and ſome few Texts of Scripture into the <hi>Amharic Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect,</hi> by reaſon of the difficulty to write it.

Scale,</hi> or <hi>Ladder.</hi> The more unskilfull ſeek for ſuch words therein which they do not underſtand in the <hi>Ethiopic;</hi> but there are very few that ſpeak <hi>Ethiopic</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> it ſelf. <hi>Gregory</hi> was perſwaded to ſpeak it for my ſake, uſing at firſt many <hi>Amharic</hi> Words, which I obſerv'd alſo to happen in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of their more unlearned Authors, before he could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom himſelf to the true <hi>Ethiopic.</hi> Both, but eſpecially the <hi>Amharic</hi> are very difficult to pronounce, for there are Seven Letters in both <hi>k. t. d. t. e. p. tz.</hi> whoſe true Power unleſs it be that of <hi>d.</hi> is altogether unknown to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> ſo that it is almoſt impoſſible for them to ſhape their Tongues to ſpeak ſeveral words, which makes me very ready to believe <hi>Plinie,</hi> when he Writes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 5.</note> That <hi>the Names of the People and Towns in</hi> Africa, <hi>are not to be utter'd but in their own Languages.</hi> Beſides, the ſound of their Vowels is ſo harſh and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that they almoſt ſcare the hearer; the obſcurity of their Language and Pronunciation correſponding with the Darkneſs of their Complexions.</p>
                  <p>But this variety of Speech is much more conſpicuous in other Kingdoms and Provinces of this Empire. <hi>Tellezius</hi> Elegantly Writes, <hi>That there are as many Languages as King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; nay; that there are different Dialects and Inhabitants in one and the ſame Kingdom. In</hi> Gojam, ſaith he, <hi>there are ſome Towns not far diſtant one from another, the</hi> Damotans, Gafatans, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wans, Setans, Shatans, <hi>beſides the</hi> Agawi, <hi>the</hi> Gonge, <hi>and the</hi> Natives, <hi>whoſe Dialects differ as much as</hi> Portugueze <hi>from</hi> Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>or</hi> French: <hi>But the Nobility and Learneder ſort, as we make uſe of</hi> Latine, <hi>ſo they ſpeak generally</hi> Amharic. That which follows, I had from <hi>Gregorie's</hi> Lips; by which the difference of their Language may be the better underſtood.</p>
                  <p>The Language of <hi>Tigra</hi> comes the neareſt to our <hi>Ethiopic;</hi> as being leaſt corrupted of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Amharic</hi> Language, thoſe of the Neighbouring Kingdoms come the neareſt; though their Dialects are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one from another; for that of <hi>Bagemdra</hi> is peculiar: <hi>Angota, Hata, Gojam,</hi> and <hi>Shewa,</hi> uſe a Dialect common to one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gafata</hi> makes uſe of many <hi>Amharic</hi> words, but in ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a Dialect as requires a long time to underſtand it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dembea</hi> ſpeaks a Language, altogether different as well from the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> as <hi>Amharic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Language of <hi>Gonga,</hi> is the ſame with that of <hi>Enarea,</hi>

                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Cambat</hi> the <hi>Gallans, Agawi,</hi> and <hi>Shankali,</hi> have each of them their diſtinct Languages, ſo that there are Eight or more Principal Languages in this Kingdom, and many more Dialects.

                     <hi>Grainus,</hi> againſt the <hi>Habeſſines,</hi> ſo ruin'd their Affairs, that they could never ſince recover their loſſes. From whence, as well the <hi>Turks</hi> as the <hi>Gallans</hi> have taken an occaſion continually to vex them with Wars and waſtful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roades. And firſt, the <hi>Turks,</hi> after they had poſſeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſlain the King of the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> ſent a Fleet into the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> to ſecure the <hi>Indian</hi> Navigation, which is vaſtly profitable to <hi>Egypt:</hi> for that the <hi>Portugueſſes,</hi> to the intent they might enjoy the ſole Trade of <hi>India,</hi> took all the Ships of the <hi>Saracens</hi> they could meet with, pretending a hatred of their Religion. The <hi>Turks</hi> therefore to ſhut up all the Ports of that Sea, made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qena,</hi> and <hi>Matzua,</hi> Iſlands that formerly belong'd to the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſines,</hi> which they might the more eaſily do, in regard the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> having their handsful by Land, took no care of their Sea Affairs. But ſoon after they became ſenſible, how vaſt an Inconvenience it was to have ſo Powerful a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; finding what Potent Succours of Men and Fire-arms the <hi>Turks</hi> ſent to aſſiſt their Enemies and thoſe that revolted from them. Nor are they leſs frequently ſenſible of it to this day; in regard that neither Men nor Merchandize can be admitted into the <hi>Gulph,</hi> unleſs they requeſt it from the <hi>Baſha</hi> or his Deputies, with vaſt Expenſes of rich Preſents.</p>
                  <p>But the Fierceneſs and Cruelty of the <hi>Gallans</hi> is much more Formidable. For they having Subdu'd many Kingdoms &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces thirſt after all the reſt; whence 'tis very probable what <hi>Tellezius</hi> writes, That unleſs they had fallen into Factions among themſelves; or that the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> were not ſo Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly ſecur'd within their own Rocks, they had been e're this utterly deſtroy'd. Therefore it ſeems but requiſite, that I ſhould here give an Accompt of the Original and Cuſtoms of theſe People: which I ſhall do as well from <hi>Tellezius,</hi> as from the Lips of our <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>What time <hi>Etana-Denghel,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>David</hi> was entangled in that fatal War with the <hi>Adelenſes;</hi> that other Plague brake forth about the Year One thouſand five hundred thirty ſeven, from the Kingdom of <hi>Bali.</hi> A certain number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants being cruelly handl'd by one <hi>Matthew</hi> a Noble-man,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59633:58"/>
Revolted; and deſpairing of Pardon, aſſociated to themſelves all the Fugitives and Criminals that fled from the Puniſhment of their Miſ-deeds, and liv'd upon Publick Spoil and Plunder, which they did with more ſucceſs, in regard the Inhabitants of <hi>Bali</hi> were not able to oppoſe 'em: And for the <hi>Habeſſines,</hi> they being involv'd in Wars with the <hi>Adelans,</hi> contemn'd thoſe inconſiderable Robbers. <hi>Tellez</hi> affirms them a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nation, and the ſame that Inhabited the <hi>Eaſtern Coaſt</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Places adjoyning to the <hi>Indian Sea:</hi> perhaps thoſe Servants, of whom <hi>Gregory</hi> makes mention, belong'd to that Neighbouring Nation, and flying to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men for Aid, diſcover'd <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> and thoſe Countries which were by their Servitude well known to them.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Gallans,</hi> puft up with their ſucceſs and rich Plunder, and increas'd in their number, having Subdu'd <hi>Bali,</hi> over-ran the neighbouring Kingdoms; But when they ſaw that what was won by Force muſt be defended by Force, they began to make Laws among themſelves, very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for the Enlargement of their deteſtable Dominion, and the preſervation of their untam'd and barbarous fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They are not ſo unlimited, as to deſpiſe Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, like the <hi>Garamants,</hi> nor do they live commonly with their Women; but they have as many Wives as they pleaſe. The young Men are not permitted to cut their Hair, before they have kill'd an Enemy in the Field, or ſome wild Beaſt, an encouragement of boldneſs and hardineſs to adventure; that by ſuch a conſpicuous Mark, the ſluggiſh and cow-hearted ſhould be diſtinguiſhed, from the bold and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. . In their Banquets and Feaſts the beſt Bit is alway ſet in the middle, and he that takes it, muſt be the firſt in any Perilous undertaking: nor is there any long conſideration: every one prepares to win that Honour to himſelf, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtimulating their Fortitude: but then there is a neceſſity of bringing ſome proof of an Enemy Slain, firſt they bring the Head, as the moſt modeſt part of the Body; but if there be any doubt of the Sex for want of a Beard, they cut off the moſt Obſcene Parts of the Slain; a thing foul to relate: theſe they number, and heap up before the Army, as if their barbarous Fortitude could not be made appear without ſuch kind of Teſtimony. However by thoſe parts it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, whether he be a Friend or an Enemy that is Slain, and therefore the Head decides that Queſtion. But their moſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59633:59"/>
prevailing encouragement in Battle is, that becauſe no man ſhould be thought to Fight for baſe hire, or out of ſervile Obedience for another man's honour, but only for his own Reputation, the Plunder is equally divided among them all. They go to War, as if they had devoted themſelves for Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with a certain Reſolution, either to Overcome or Dye: from whence proceeds great obſtinacy in Combat. They uſe but few Weapons, at a diſtance they fight with Lances or Darts; hand to hand with Clubs or Stakes burnt at the end; relying more upon their Courage, than their Hands: They make their Shield of the skins of Oxen, or wild <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falo's;</hi> formerly they fought for the moſt part afoot, now more frequently a Horſe-back. And though the <hi>Abeſſines</hi> are generally more in Number, and better Arm'd, as alſo more skilful Horſe-men, yet are they not able to withſtand the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of their furious Onſets. But how they may be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd we ſhall then declare, when we come to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning the Power of the Kings of <hi>Habeſſinia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being thus bred up to War, they abhor all peaceful Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, believing it much better to raviſh wealth, then get it by honeſt Labour; they willingly eat the Bread which they find among the <hi>Abeſſines,</hi> but do not love to grind the Corn; for they neither till nor ſow their Lands, never minding Agriculture, but only grazing of Cattle: their Herds they drive before 'em, as well in War as in Peace, through the moſt fertile Paſtures; upon the raw Fleſh of which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally feed without Bread, and then drink their Milk; uſing the ſame ſort of Food and Drink, both at home and in the field.</p>
                  <p>They never cumber themſelves with any Baggage, not ſo much as Kitchin Utenſils, only wooden Cups to drink their Milk in. Such wild Nations are generally a Terror to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliz'd People, whom Aboundance renders ſlothful, and Riches effeminate. Thus the <hi>Cimbrians, Goths, Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> over-ran the more civiliz'd Kingdoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> Thus the <hi>Oriental Tartars</hi> formerly Invaded <hi>China.</hi> The <hi>Gallans,</hi> if at any time overcome by the <hi>Habeſſines,</hi> retire with their Herds into remote Corners; Oppoſing only wild De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and Solitudes for their Enemies to Encounter. Every Eight Years they chuſe one amongſt them for their Leader, as it were a kind of Maſter of the Horſe, whom they call <hi>Luva;</hi> and him all the reſt of the Captains obey; but that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59633:59"/>
is only in time of War: his firſt Enterprize is, to Muſter the People together, and Invade <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> for the ſake of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Bootie.</p>
                  <p>They have a Language peculiar to themſelves, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from all the reſt of the <hi>Habeſſinian</hi> Dialects; which argues their Original both forrain and common to all their Tribes; they admit of Circumciſion among themſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by any ancient Cuſtom, obſerved by many of the Neighbouring <hi>Ethnics,</hi> or for that they find the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Abeſſines</hi> to do the ſame.</p>
                  <p>They have no Idols, and but very little Divine Worſhip. If you ask them concerning God, or any Supreme <hi>Numen,</hi> or who it is that Governs the Earth with ſo much Order and Conſtancy? they anſwer, <hi>Heaven,</hi> which embraces in their view, all the reſt; however they adore that <hi>Heaven</hi> with no Solemn Worſhip, more barbarous than the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> themſelves: nor yet are they altogether void of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for they aſpire to a large ſhare of Ingenuity, and in aptneſs to learn equalize the ſmarteſt of the <hi>Habeſſines.</hi> From whence we may obſerve, that there is no ſort of Human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſo fierce and ſavage which may not be civiliz'd by Education and Learning. Many have ſubmitted to the Inſtructions of Chriſtianity, and perſiſted conſtant in the Faith. <hi>Tellezius</hi> teſtifies, and <hi>Gregory</hi> farther witneſſed, That ſeveral Thouſands of the <hi>Gallans</hi> were Converted to the Chriſtian Religion, and ſubmitted to Baptiſm under King <hi>Baſilides.</hi> Now let me tell you, this is that formidable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has ruin'd the Power and Dominion of the <hi>Abeſſines;</hi> inſomuch, that they have torn from the <hi>Abeſſine</hi> King above the half of thoſe Territories which his Anceſtors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd; for after their Irruption out of <hi>Bali,</hi> they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Provinces of <hi>Gedmam, Angota, Dawara, Wed, Fatagar, Ifat, Guragea, Ganza, Conta, Damota, Waleka, Bizama,</hi> part of <hi>Shewa,</hi> and many intermix'd Kingdoms. Nor had they ſtopp'd there, had they not, being rent into Diviſions among themſelves, turn'd their Arms one againſt another, and given the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> a little breathing time: for Concord among Equals rarely long attends Proſperity. At this time they are divided into certain Tribes, (Seventy or more,) and as it were into Two Nations; of which the more <hi>Weſterly</hi> are by the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> call'd <hi>Bertuma Galla,</hi> thoſe that lye to the <hi>Eaſt, Boren Galla:</hi> thoſe <hi>Eaſterly</hi> and <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly,</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:59633:60"/>
in a manner encircle <hi>Habaſſia,</hi> and harraſe it with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Incurſions. They have alſo ſeparated <hi>Cambata</hi> and <hi>Enarea</hi> from the reſt of the Body, as having ſubdu'd the Kingdoms that lye between; which makes it very difficult for the <hi>Abeſſine</hi> Prince to convoy home the Tribute of thoſe Kingdoms. Thus there is a neceſſity for the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> to be always in War with theſe People; nor is there any hopes of regaining their ancient and priſtine Glory, unleſs that Nation be firſt reduc'd into order. The King has prudently made uſe of their Inteſtine Diſcords; for he has plac'd the Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Dembea</hi> and <hi>Gojam,</hi> and ſucceſsfully makes uſe of their Arms againſt their Country-men: for as they are the moſt excellent Antidotes, which are compos'd of the moſt Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Animals themſelves; ſo the <hi>Barbarians</hi> themſelves are the moſt prevalent Force againſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us take a view of the Kingdom of <hi>Zandero,</hi> till lately undiſcovered, although contiguous to <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above four or five days from it. The Inhabitants are but little more civil than the <hi>Gallans,</hi> only that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a King, and have an awful reſpect for ſomething, whether it be God or Devil. The King being dead, the next of Kin retire into the Wood, and there modeſtly wait the Election of the Nobility, who in queſt of their King newly Elected among themſelves, enter the Wood, guided by a certain Bird, of the <hi>Eagle</hi>-kind, which by the Noiſe it makes diſcovers the Conceal'd Perſon: preſently they find him ſurrounded with a Guard of Lyons, Dragons, and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>(d)</hi> aſſembled together by a ſort of Incantation to the Ancients unknown: At firſt he makes a reſiſtance againſt the Electors, and wounds thoſe that he can, that he may ſeem to be Conſtrained to take the Government upon him: ſoon after, as they are going along, another Gang, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs of ancient Cuſtom, endeavour to Reſcue their King from the other Party, claiming to themſelves the Honour of being the Perſons that ſet the Crown upon the King's Head, and purchaſing the hopes of Royal Favour, by means of a ſeeming Sport, which oft-times proves very Bloody. <hi>Thus inſtead of Inauguration, the</hi> African <hi>Gentiles think it Lawful to attone the Devil with human Blood.</hi> The King proud in the height of Poverty, not contented with the few ſteps to his Throne, gets upon the Beam of his Houſe, from whence he looks down, as from a Gallery, and gives Anſwers to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59633:60"/>
Embaſſadors. <hi>Antony Fernandez,</hi> Travelling with the <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinian</hi> Ambaſſador into that Kingdom, having viewed this ſame <hi>Lybian Soveraign,</hi> compares him for colour and geſture to a Rampant <hi>Monkey.</hi> Nor does the word <hi>Zendero,</hi> which is the Name of the Kingdom intimate much leſs, in regard that <hi>Zendero</hi> ſignifies an Ape. <hi>Tellezius</hi> adds, That it is the Cuſtom of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> if their King be wounded to kill him, which is conformable to the Nature of <hi>Monkeys,</hi> who having receiv'd a wound, tear and ſcratch it ſo long, till their Entrails drop out, or that they loſe all their Blood.</p>
                  <p>The next Kingdom is <hi>Alaba,</hi> conterminous Eaſterly to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat;</hi> the Governour of which, in the Sixteenth Year of this Century was call'd <hi>Alico.</hi> To the Eaſt, <hi>Habesſinia</hi> is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by vaſt Deſerts, and open Solitary level Wilderneſſes, and therefore altogether unknown. Southward, it joyns to the Kingdom of <hi>Sennar</hi> or <hi>Fund,</hi> Govern'd by its peculiar King, formerly a Tributary to the <hi>Abesſines,</hi> but now Abſolute. He Poſſeſt a part of the ancient <hi>Nubia,</hi> near to which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd the Kingdom of <hi>Balou,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants are by the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> call'd <hi>Balous:</hi> their King was formerly Lord of <hi>Suaqena,</hi> and in friendſhip with the <hi>Abesſines;</hi> now he only receives the half of the Maritine Tribute from the <hi>Turks.</hi> From what we have ſaid, it may be eaſily gathered, with how many Adverſaries and Enemies <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded; ſo that the <hi>Aberſines</hi> may not improperly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Country to the Flower of Saffron <hi>Denguelat,</hi> ſet about with Thorns. For being perpetually ſtruggling with their Foes, they rather apply themſelves to the Arts of War, then Peace; which ſeldom thrive amidſt the Noiſe of War and public Contention.</p>

                     <p>It remains to ſpeak of the <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>Habesſinia,</hi> who are neither <hi>Africans</hi> nor Forreiners; for that ſome time ſince they have ſubmitted themſelves to the <hi>Habesſine</hi> Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For of the Four hundred, which <hi>Chriſtopher Gamez</hi> brought to the ſuccour of the <hi>Abiſſines</hi> in the <hi>Adelan</hi> War, about One hundred and ſeventy ſuperviving, in the ſpace of one Age multiply'd ſo faſt, that when the Fathers of the Society came thither, they were able to Muſter Fourteen hundred

Fighting men: a ſmall handful, but very conſiderable to the Party to which they adhere, as retaining their ancient Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and dexterity in handling their Arms; for the uſe of Fire-arms ſuperiour to the <hi>Habesſines</hi> or any of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>

                     <p>When the War with the <hi>Adelenſes</hi> was ended and <hi>Grainus</hi> ſlain; having certain Lands and Poſſeſſions granted them by <hi>Claudius,</hi> they choſe themſelves Wives, got Children, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſh'd after the manner of the Country with Mules and Servants and other neceſſaries, began to live comfortably; for while the ſucceſs of their aſſiſtance was freſh in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they were courted, and every where kindly entertained, and had the free liberty of their Religion: but theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges were abridg'd by <hi>Menas</hi> ſucceſſor to <hi>Claudius.</hi> They impatiently brook'd to ſee their kindneſs ſo ungratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talliated; it being the nature of Soldiers rather to do, than receive injuries. However, their Lands were taken away, (for jealouſie began to Rule) or elſe exchang'd for worſe, and thoſe bordering upon the Enemy; ſo that at length the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> were forc'd to allow them Twelve hundred Patacks a year to maintain them. In this laſt Century while the Fathers of the Society flouriſh'd they wanted for nothing, but liv'd in great Proſperity: but the Fathers loſing their Credit, they were again reduc'd to the extremity of Miſery. So that it was the fear of <hi>Mendez,</hi> leſt in that miſerable Poverty, forgetful of their Native Language and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, they ſhould revolt to the Religion and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Habeſſines.</hi>

However they do not caſt it quite off, as the Popes do, but aſſume both together. Thus <hi>Zar-a-Jacob</hi> in an Epiſtle to the Tome of Councils, writes himſelf <hi>Zar-a-Jacob,</hi> and our <hi>Imperial,</hi> or <hi>Inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Name <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> This Name deſign'd for a good Omen, generally ſignifies Reverence and Veneration, as <hi>Atznaf-Saghed;</hi> Venerable to the Ends of the Earth; <hi>Melec-Saghed,</hi> a venerable Ruler. Sometimes they take the Names of Gems; as <hi>Adamas-Saghed,</hi> the venerable Diamond. <hi>Encua-Saghed,</hi> or <hi>Wanag-Saghed,</hi> a Precious Gemm. This was the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59633:64"/>
Name of <hi>David,</hi> the Son of <hi>Naod,</hi> the Father of <hi>Claudius.</hi> Whence I believe it came to paſs, that his Embaſſador <hi>Tzaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaabus,</hi> being ſent into <hi>Portugal,</hi> call'd him <hi>Pretious John,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Prete-Gianni,</hi> as judging that the Perſon could not but be precious, that bare the Name of a Precious Gem. Sometimes ſeveral Names, and thoſe variouſly pronounc'd are clapp'd together. For that ſame <hi>David,</hi> beſides the two Names already mention'd, was Baptiz'd <hi>Etana Denghel, The Virgins Incenſe;</hi> or as others will have it, <hi>Lebna Denghel,</hi> The Virgins <hi>Storax.</hi> But this multitude and variety of Names often renders the Hiſtory imperfect, while many times that is ſpoken of many Perſons, which ſhould be only ſaid of one. Thus that famous King <hi>Caleb,</hi> that ruin'd the Kingdom of the <hi>Homerites,</hi> was by the Greeks call'd <hi>Eleſbaas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King's Seal which they uſe in Sealing their Letters, is a Lion holding a Croſs, with this Motto: <hi>The Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Juda <hi>has won.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ridiculous therefore are thoſe Arms which are ſet forth by a certain <hi>French</hi> Author in the Fabulous Hiſtory of <hi>Tzagaxi,</hi> and which the Impoſtor himſelf aſſum'd in his Epiſtles to <hi>John Wiſling,</hi> a Phyſitian of <hi>Padua.</hi>

For neither before nor after did the Letters which the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Kings ſent to the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> appear with any ſuch tumid Style or oſtentatious Lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Letter from <hi>Helena</hi> brought by <hi>Matthew</hi> into <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> began with onely a bare Salutation without any Title; to omit the falſe and forgotten names of Kingdoms in thoſe other forged Titles. Again, how nonſenſical it is for a Prince to mention ſuch an uncertainty as the Queen of <hi>Sheba's</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or the Fountains of <hi>Nile</hi> among the Titles of his Empire? as if the Fountains of <hi>Nile</hi> were ſuch a Miracle to the <hi>Abeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,</hi> as they were to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines.</hi> What a pleaſant thing it would be if any one ſhould add to our Emperour's Titles, the Fountains of the <hi>Danaw</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Schaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> which were alſo unknown to the ancient Philoſophers? How idly are thoſe proper names of <hi>Son of the Pillar of Sion; Son of the Seed of Jacob; Son of the hand of Mary,</hi> turn'd into Appellatives? Then for <hi>Naod, Alvarez</hi> reads <hi>Nabu;</hi> which makes me believe him to be the Author of that ſurreptitious Title; becauſe he miſtakes the word all along in his Itinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

preſents gave him an Interview at his own Court; where ſhe learnt from him the true Worſhip of God: And at her return, after a certain ſpace of time ſhe brought forth her Son <hi>Menilehec</hi> begot by <hi>Salomon,</hi> and whom he had nam'd <hi>David.</hi> This young Prince was afterwards ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to his Father, where by his order and care he was Exactly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law of God. Being grown up, he was anointed King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and ſent back into his own Kingdom, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with ſeveral noble <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and Doctors of the Law, who were joyn'd with him, as Friends and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Miniſters of State; among the reſt went alſo <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zadoc</hi> the High Prieſt. And this is that Prince from whom all the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Kings and the chiefeſt of the Nobility derive their Pedegrees to this day.</p>
                  <p>But then follows a Tale no leſs inſipid, then misbecoming the new King. <hi>That theſe noble Jews, nefariouſly and Sacrilegiouſly took away with them the Ark of the Covenant, together with the Tables of the Ten Commandements, the Temple being careleſly lookt after, and the Gates being left open as it were by the Providence of God.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Mother, upon his return, reſign'd her Kingdom to her Son <hi>David,</hi> obliging him and all the Nobility of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That they ſhould never for the future admit a Woman to rule over them; but onely males of the Line of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it has bin the Long and Serious Enquiry of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, of what Countrey and of what Progenie this ſame Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> while he writes the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Jews,</hi> an Author not to be contemn'd; tho in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign matters not ſo well vers'd, affirms her to be one <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caule,</hi> mentioned hy <hi>Herodotus.</hi> And yet in the Modern Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> there is no ſuch Name to be found, unleſs ſhe ſhould be the ſame whom he calls <hi>Nitocris.</hi> That <hi>Nicaule,</hi> according to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> was not onely Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> but of <hi>Egypt;</hi> in which 'tis to be fear'd he is foully miſtaken. However, that ſhe came out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients agree, as <hi>Origen, Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Anſelm,</hi> whom Cardinal <hi>Toletus Cites.</hi> Others on the contrary, declare her to have come out of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as <hi>Juſtin, Cyprian, Epiphanius, Cyril, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Baronius, Suarez, Lorinus,</hi> and at large <hi>Pineda</hi> in his Treatiſe of the Acts of <hi>Salomon;</hi> where he labours by ten Reaſons to confirm his Opinion. Of which, thoſe that ſeem to carry moſt weight are theſe: <hi>That</hi> Saba <hi>is ſeated in</hi> Arabia <hi>to the South of</hi> Judea. <hi>That Camels, Spice, Gemms and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59633:67"/>
Gold are more conſiſtent with</hi> Arabia <hi>than with</hi> Ethiopia. But theſe different Opinions are eaſily reconcil'd; if as many of the Old Writers held, the ancient <hi>Ethiopia</hi> extended it ſelf into <hi>Arabia.</hi> For they aſſert the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Homerites</hi> to have bin Nations of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which without queſtion were formerly ſeated in <hi>Arabia the Happy.</hi> That Region which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call by the Name, of <hi>Cuſh,</hi> by the 70 Interpreters is rendred <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> From hence <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe his Wife, who is call'd the <hi>Ethiopeſs;</hi> and yet that County is a part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> according to the Common acceptation now a days, whence the <hi>Arabians</hi> are call'd <hi>Cuſhites.</hi> Therefore was the <hi>Ethiopia</hi> of the Ancients two-fold, <hi>Aſiatic</hi> and <hi>African,</hi> or Oriental and Weſtern. For the Ancients did not limit the principal Parts of the World as we do now; while they extended <hi>India</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> and brought <hi>Ethiopia</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and believed that the <hi>Indians</hi> inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited beyond the <hi>Ethiopians.</hi> Nor did they think that <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> were diſtinct parts of the Orbe of the Earth, but onely particular Regions. <hi>Egypt</hi> ſeemed to belong ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Africa;</hi> and others made <hi>Nilus,</hi> to be the bounds between thoſe two Continents. And, which is moſt remarkable, the Antient <hi>Arabia</hi> was not of ſo large an Extent, as now the Modern is. For the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> were plac'd beyond the Limits of <hi>Arabia.</hi> The <hi>Arabian</hi> Gulph was alſo taken onely for a part or Bay of the Red Sea. All which things the Geographers of later Times have much more diſtinctly reform'd. So that altho by Us, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans</hi> are accounted to be a Region of the Southern <hi>Arabia</hi> that lyes upon the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean, and conſequently toward the utmoſt Limits of Land there, yet may the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> according to the Opinion of the Ancients, be ſaid to come out of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Nor does it argue any thing of abſurdity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that ſhe might at the ſame time command that part of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> which lay upon the Oppoſite Shore, and at ſo near a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> made no queſtion, but that ſhe was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Line of the Sons of <hi>Homer,</hi> or the <hi>Homerites,</hi> and that ſhe was the daughter<note n="(n)" place="bottom">He was the twenty firſt, as is to be ſeen in the Catalogue of the <hi>Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> King, which the learned Pocock ſet forth in his Specimen of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Hiſtory <hi>p.</hi> 59.</note> of King <hi>Hod-hadi,</hi> They call her <hi>Belkis,</hi> and affirm her to have bin, not the Concubine,

                     </note> mov'd thereto by theſe Arguments: becauſe the continuation of Officers both Civil and Military, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cuſtomes and Ceremonies made uſe of in the Hebrew Common-wealth ſo long ſince, are ſtill obſerv'd there to this day. So that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> ſeem'd to him to be a certain live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentation of the Ancient Hebrew Government. And his other reaſon was, for that he underſtood many places of Scripture much better ſince he came into <hi>Ethiopia. Tellezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> none of the mildeſt Cenſurers of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Traditions, in this thing, agrees throughout with the Patriarch, adding, That it ought to ſeem ſtrange to no Perſon, that <hi>Salomon,</hi> who took to wife the Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and alſo lov'd the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abitiſh, Idumean, Sidonian</hi> and <hi>Hethic</hi> Women, ſhould deſire to taſt the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Variety. The <hi>Habeſsines</hi> alſo call'd the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of their Kings <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> neither do they think any other perſons worthy of the Scepter but the Male Iſſue of <hi>Menilehec;</hi> who for that reaſon bear the Lyon in their Royal Coats, with this Impreſe, <hi>The Lyon of the Tribe of</hi> Judah <hi>has overcome:</hi> to demonſtrate that they are deſcended from the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Line of <hi>David:</hi> nor that <hi>Candaces</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch learnt the Orthodox Religion from any other then from the <hi>Iſraelites. Gregory</hi> alſo averr'd to me the ſame things, and that the Book wherein thoſe things were record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was call'd the <hi>Glory of the Kings,</hi> and was of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among them; and that no perſon in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> doubted of the Truth thereof. He added, That all the Offices, both Civil and Military, of which the Patriarch diſcourſes in his Letter, <hi>(q)</hi> are ſtill continu'd in the ſame Families, and that they who Enjoy them, can make it appear how long thoſe Employments have been officiated by their Anceſtors, from Generation to Generation. However, I do not think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59633:68"/>
to augment or leſſen the Credit of theſe things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thoſe <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Inſtitutions, Offices, Cuſtoms and Manners, of which the Patriarch ſpeaks in general, ſhall be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly made known to me; that I ſee the Genealogies of thoſe public Miniſters, whom <hi>Gregory</hi> mentions; and that I hear the anſwers to ſuch doubts as I ſhall propoſe. I find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Conſent of the Nation, and the affirmation of their Kings; for <hi>Claudius</hi> calls his Anceſtors <hi>Iſraelitiſh Kings:</hi> and at the time of Inauguration, they proclaim the Creation of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh King:</hi> and they who are kept in the Rock <hi>Geſhen,</hi> bear the Name of <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> And laſtly, I find ſome Rites and Cuſtoms agreeing with thoſe of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Nor is it any wonder to me more than to <hi>Tellezius,</hi> or diſagreeable from <hi>Salomon</hi>'s practice, that after ſo many profound and knotty Riddles unloos'd, he ſhould unty the Queen of <hi>Sheba's</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Girdle. Again, if the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> are Colonies of the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Homerites,</hi> it may as well be granted that the <hi>Queen of the South</hi> deriv'd her Pedigree from them. Yet there are many things that ſeem to perſwade the contrary. For as to the <hi>Iſraelitiſh Rites,</hi> we ſhall hereafter ſhew, that they might have bin introduc'd long after <hi>Salomon</hi>'s time upon other grounds; and that they were common as well to the Gentiles as to the Chriſtians. For if the true Worſhip of God began from that time, how came it to be preſerv'd without Synagogues, and the Sacred Volumes? But they have them not, either in the Hebrew Language, nor tranſlated into their own. Nor does the Appellation of <hi>Iſraelitiſh Kings,</hi> argue the Verity of their Deſcent, no more than if any one ſhould aſſert our Emperours deſcended from the Ancient <hi>Romans.</hi> But if, as the Poſterity of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> they continue in their Offices, or are ſo ſollicitous to preſerve their Poſterity; why not as well in preſerving the Hiſtories of their Anceſtors? and in perpetuating Kindneſſes between their Relations and thoſe of the ſame Tribe or Family? why not more choice in their Marriages? more earneſt in Viſiting the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> and in giving mutual aſſiſtance to their Brethren? Eſpecially when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the Brother of <hi>Menehelec,</hi> ſuffer'd that great Loſs of the revolt of the Ten Tribes? and when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by <hi>Siſack</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whom no man better than the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> could have diverted? when the <hi>Jews</hi> were oppreſs'd by ſo many Enemies; when they were carry'd away Captive to <hi>Babylon?</hi> when ruin'd by the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria?</hi> and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59633:68"/>
when ſubdu'd by the <hi>Romans?</hi> For then the Paſſages were free thorough <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the <hi>Red Sea</hi> was open. Laſtly, which is of moſt moment, if the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> receiv'd their divine Ceremonies and Religion from <hi>Salomon,</hi> why not his human Learning? For Learning and Religion generally go together, as may be prov'd by the Examples of many Nations. But as to this, their manner of writing and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing differs very much, though ſome of their letters ſeem to be borrow'd from the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Laſtly, the <hi>Jews</hi> inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down all over <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> it would be of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to put theſe Queſtions to them, When? and how they came thither? What they think of theſe Traditions of the <hi>Habiſsines?</hi> and what they find in their Books concerning them? it not being probable that all their Books ſhould be loſt in a Country ſo well defended by nature?

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOW then they acknowledg <hi>Menilehec-El-Haqim</hi> to be the firſt King. Which name ſome interpret, <hi>As He.</hi> Others, <hi>As God created him like me.</hi> Neither of which interpretations can be pick'd from the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Language. However, <hi>Ebn-El-Haqim,</hi> is apparently in Arabic the <hi>Son of Wiſdome,</hi> or of <hi>Salomon.

Queen <hi>Makeda.</hi> Then, ſaith he, four and twenty Kings ſucceeded, till <hi>Bazen</hi> reign'd; and yet in the next Chapter, writes him to be the Twentieth from <hi>Menihelec</hi> the Son of <hi>Salomon:</hi> but neither does he name them, neither will we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Reader amidſt theſe uncertainties.</p>
                  <p>There is leſs doubt, that Chriſt our Saviour was born in the time of <hi>Bazen,</hi> more particularly in the Eighteenth Year of his Reign. Here is no mention made of <hi>Candaces,</hi> whom ſome of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> acknowledg for their Queen: in this contradictory to themſelves, while they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Female to the Throne. And therefore it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that we ſhould in expounding that place in the <hi>Acts, c.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 27. which ſpeaks of the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia's</hi> Eunuch, find out ſome other more probable part of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> bordering upon <hi>Aegypt:</hi> which with ſome probability we may conjecture to be the Iſland of <hi>Meroe;</hi> in regard that <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifies, That in that Iland reign'd a Certain Woman call'd <hi>Candace,</hi> and that the ſucceeding Queens aſſum'd that name afterwards for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years. After <hi>Bazen,</hi> for the ſpace of 327 Years <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was govern'd by Thirteen Kings, as <hi>Tellezius</hi> records it. But he mentions not one of their names, perhaps becauſe he found there was nothing of certainty. From the time that<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Abreha is an <hi>Arabic</hi> word, contractedly ſpoken. <hi>Abra:</hi> Erroneouſly taken for <hi>Abraham,</hi> which they pronounce <hi>Ibrahim.</hi>

from Heaven; which ſoon after anſwer'd his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>John</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſending him Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, under the Conduct of that moſt Valiant and Noble Portugueſe <hi>Chriſtopher Gamas,</hi> who with a ſmall Band of Four hundred <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Foot Soldiers, overthrew vaſt Armies of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and laid the Foundations of regaining the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Empire. <hi>Claudius</hi> was a man of a moſt Princely Port. For beſides the outward Grace of his Perſon, he was endu'd with many Virtues of the Mind, which made him judg'd by all worthy of the Royal Dignity. The Fathers of the Society applauded him for a moſt Prudent Prince, though otherwiſe not ſo well pleaſed with him, becauſe he had not ſhew'd that Affection to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd; though he did not prohibit the Divine Worſhip of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; nor hinder'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts from the free Exerciſe of their Religion. He was alſo Learned, and well inſtructed in Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity. So that, as <hi>Telle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> witneſſes, his Teachers ſeem'd illiterate in compariſon of their Scholar. For in Diſputes with the Fathers of the Society, he himſelf for the moſt part would argue, with ſo much vehemence, that ſometimes he put them hard to it to make him an Anſwer. And when he obſerv'd that the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> were blam'd for retaining certain <hi>Judaic</hi> Rights contrary to the Chriſtian Laws, he put into Writing a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct Confeſſion of Faith, by which he clear'd all Objections, and excus'd himſelf and his Subjects. That Confeſſion we formerly<note n="(f)" place="bottom">In <hi>England,</hi> Anno <hi>1667.</hi> It is alſo added to our <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Lexicon and Grammar.</note> ſet forth, and ſhall publiſh again in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary: So that the Fathers of the Society could object no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Schiſm againſt ſo great and famous a Monarch. He reign'd Eighteen years and ſome Months, with great toil and trouble, by reaſon of his continual Wars with the <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans,</hi> who mindful of the overthrows they had receiv'd, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attempted Revenge.

He left no Children behind him; whence it came to paſs,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59633:74"/>
that the Right of Succeſſion being very ambiguous in <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> the Contention was long dubious between his Brother <hi>Menas,</hi> and <hi>Taſcar,</hi> the Natural Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſecond Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceaſed. For this claim'd the Kingdom in right of his Father, while he liv'd, the Elder Brother, the other alledg'd himſelf to be the nearer in Blood, than he who was Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. The Controverſie being decided by the Sword, <hi>Tascar</hi> was taken in the Battel, and thrown headlong down a Rock.</p>

For he hated the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> as minding their own Affairs; and forbid the uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, not ſuffering any of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> to go into the <hi>Latin</hi> Churches. He alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd the Liberty which his Predeceſſor <hi>Claudius</hi> had granted to the Wives and Families of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> to frequent the <hi>Roman</hi> Chappels; which caus'd many to wiſh again for the Clemency of <hi>Claudius,</hi> with which they were not contented however before. He deſpis'd the Romiſh Biſhop <hi>Andrew Oviedo,</hi> who in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> was ſent to make way for the new Patriarch; and for ſome Months kept him in Priſon. Nor was he much more kind to his own Subjects. For which reaſon, out of an averſion to his Proceedings, they revolted from him in ſeveral Parts. Among the reſt, <hi>Iſaac Bahrnagaſſus,</hi> a man in great Power, and skill'd in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Diſcipline, calling the <hi>Turks</hi> to his Aſſiſtance upon the Twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> 1562. overcame the King in Battel, and ſlew him: to the great detriment of <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> For ever ſince that time, the <hi>Turks</hi> have been Maſters of the Coaſt of the Red Sea. He left three Sons, <hi>Sarza-Denghel, Leſanax,</hi> and <hi>Tazcar.</hi> Of which the laſt dy'd without Children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sarza-Denghel,</hi> taking the Government upon him, call'd himſelf <hi>Malac-Saghed,</hi> and was Inaugurated after the ancient manner at <hi>Axuma.</hi> His Fortune was equal to his Vertues; for he was ſtout of Hand, and wiſe in Counſel. And firſt he drave the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were Maſters of <hi>Dobarva,</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59633:75"/>
of the Maritime Province, out of <hi>Tigra.</hi> He would alſo have driven them out of the Port of <hi>Arkiko,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Matzua,</hi> had he not been recall'd to defend his Upland Dominions from the Incurſions of the <hi>Galans.</hi> Theſe People by the Rapines and Plunder of five and twenty years, while the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> were buſied in ſo many other Wars increaſed to that power, that now they over-ran <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> not with ſcattering Troops, but with compleat Armies. So that all the time of his Reign, though otherwiſe proſperous in War, he was forc'd to ſtruggle with them. However he ſubdu'd <hi>Enarea,</hi> and caus'd the Prince thereof to turn Chriſtian. For he carefully obſerv'd the Chriſtian Religion, according to the Conſtitutions of the Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi> Rites he left indifferent. And for the Fathers of the Society; he often commended their Converſation of Life, and their Studies, but deſpiſed their Doctrine, ſaying, That their Manners, and not their Doctrine was to be imitated. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Manners and Doctrine do not always accord. And therefore, <hi>ſometimes the Doctrine is to be approv'd, where the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not Correſpondent; and ſometimes the Manners are to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, where the Doctrine is not to be follow'd.</hi> But tho he were Proſperous in his Affairs of Government and War; yet in his Marriage he was unfortunate; for his Wife <hi>Mariamſena</hi> brought him many Daughters, but not one Son. He had two Natural Sons, of which one was call'd <hi>Za-Marjam,</hi> and the other <hi>Jacob;</hi> but they could not ſucceed by the Laws of the<note n="(h)" place="bottom">

And therefore it fell out with him as with many others, who are more addicted to illicit Concubinage, than lawful Matrimony, that they want Succeſſors from their own Loins; and frequently expoſe their Kingdoms to War and Bloodſhed upon Diſputes of Succeſſion. Firſt, therefore he ſhew'd to the Nobility <hi>Za-Denghel,</hi> his Brother <hi>Lecanax</hi>'s Son, as the Son of a Prince adorn'd in Royal Habit. Then again, ſome few Months before his Death, he began to change his mind, either envying a greater Adoration to the Riſing than the Setting Sun; or whether it were that <hi>Za-Denghel</hi> himſelf, certain of the Succeſſion gave the leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59633:75"/>
to his Uncle, or whether his Diſpoſition were not grateful to the Nobility. However it were, <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Child of Seven years of Age, never ſeen before to the King, came to Court; which was no obſcure intimation, that he would be preferr'd before <hi>Za-Denghel,</hi> as being of the King's own Blood. The Grandees, whether they durſt not admoniſh the King; or whether they had an intention to uſurp the Government, under pretence of being Guardians to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, conſented to the King: But ſoon after they taught us to underſtand how uncertain the Tranquillity of Kingdoms is, where the Right of Succeſſion is uncertain, or that there are no Rules; but that the grand Affairs of a Kingdom are at the diſpoſal of Courtiers, intent upon their own Intereſt. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, moſt wonderful to relate, when the King upon his return from the War with the <hi>Gallans,</hi> fell ſick, and found himſelf near his end, Right and Juſtice more prevail'd with him, than Hatred againſt his Brother's Son, or love to his own Illegitimate, and therefore calling before him the chief of his Nobility, he is reported to have ſpoken thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seeing that the end of my life Approaches, I thought that next the Care of my Soul, that of my Kingdom was the chiefeſt, the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of which I have always held no leſs dear to me, than the Salvation of my own Soul. True it is, that having none Legitimate, I always lov'd</hi> Jacob <hi>as my own. And I have obſerv'd in him Endowments of Mind not unworthy ſo fair an Inheritance; ſo that I could not have had any reaſon to repent, had I Eſtabliſh'd him my Succeſſor; nor you, had you yielded him Obedience. But now I prefer the Love of my Country, and the Laws of the Kingdom before my private Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Therefore it is, that I recommend to your Allegiance</hi> Za-Denghel <hi>my Brother's Son, my neareſt Kinſman, ſtout in War, Mature in years, conſpicuous for his virtues, and one that by thoſe virtues Merits the high Dignity which is due to him by Birth.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ſaid, in a ſhort while after he expir'd.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>But as it was a thing abſolutely unexpected by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that the King would change his Mind; ſo the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs among themſelves during the Minority of the King, was that which they had already deeply fix'd in their minds; nay more, they had under-hand already divided the great Offices of the Kingdom. And therefore repining to find the Power thus as it were raviſh'd out of their hands, they perfidiouſly enter into a Conſpiracy. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they conceal the Death of the King, and ſending away
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59633:76"/>
ſome few Bands of Soldiers drawn together in haſt, they cauſe <hi>Za-Denghel</hi> to be apprehended, and carry'd away into the Iſland of <hi>Udeka,</hi> lying in the <hi>Tzanic Lake;</hi> and then changing his Impriſonment from Rock to Rock, carry'd him up and down to prevent his Conſpiring with the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People. The ſame Trap was lay'd for <hi>Suſneus;</hi> for that they fear'd leaſt he being youthful, and brave, ſeeing the Order of the Succeſſion ſo diſturb'd, ſhould put in for a ſhare and aſſert his Claim; as afterwards he did. But he eſcap'd in good time to the <hi>Gallans,</hi> where he fix'd himſelf among them againſt the threatning Danger, reſolving if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to make uſe of their Aſſiſtance. The Chiefs of the Faction were <hi>Ras-Athanaſius,</hi> a man of high Authority; and <hi>Keflawahed,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Tigra,</hi> who having cajol'd into the Conſpiracy, the Queen Dowager his Mother-in-Law, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of preſerving her Power, by means of her Son's nonage, as it were under colour of lawful Power, they preſently ſet the Crown upon the head of <hi>Jacob,</hi> then a Child of Seven years of Age, and therefore call'd the Infant King; reſerving the management of Affairs to themſelves. A <hi>trium-virate</hi> unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with a Woman, and therefore not like to endure long. For, ſeven years after <hi>Jacob</hi> coming to be of Age, impatient of ſo many Tutors, aſſum'd the Reins of Government into his own hands; perhaps more imperiouſly than might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Lad of 15 years of Age. The Guardians therefore taking it ill to be ſo ſoon depriv'd of their Power, ſeeing their Obedience would immediately follow, choſe rather to obey their lawful King, and render themſelves deſerving of his new Favours. Therefore before <hi>Jacob</hi> could fix him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Throne, as it were induc'd out of Repentance, that they had preferr'd an Infant and Illegitimate before a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Succeſſor and of ripe Age, they recall <hi>Za-Denghel</hi> then lurking in the moſt remote Mountains of the Kingdom, and ſalute him King by the Name of <hi>Aſnaff-Saghed;</hi> which they did the ſooner, and that with the more ſpeed, that they might have the leſs reaſon to give an Accompt of what was done, to the new King.</p>

and Clemency, and truſting to his own Right, would never incur the cenſure of being Cruel in cutting off his Noſe and Eyes, which was uſually done to others in the ſame Condition, and to which he himſelf was advis'd. For he ſcorn'd to pollute himſelf with a Crime after the manner of Tyrants, who diſtruſtful of their own Right, or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Affections, count it a piece of Policy to cut off their Rivals in Empire, how innocent ſoever, imputing to them before-hand the future Crimes that may happen to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not by them, but any Promoters of Sedition: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſent the degraded King into <hi>Enarea,</hi> the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Kingdom of <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> under a ſtrict Guard, in a ſhort time to be reſtored to the Kingdom to his own Ruin.</p>

                     <hi>Za-Denghel,</hi> for Grace of Utterance and Majeſty of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was equally Venerable (as are moſt of the Princes of the Royal Blood of <hi>Habeſsinia</hi>) in the moſt flouriſhing years of pleaſing Youth; and through his Experience of Adverſity and Proſperity worthy of the high degree, to which he had arriv'd; and which was more than all, mild and ready to Forgive. For among all the crow'd of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemies, he never puniſh'd any, as by Law he might have done: but without any diſgrace, ſuffer'd them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their ſeveral Offices, and in the ſame degrees of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour even the Queen her ſelf: ſo mild and gentle even to a fault is the Diſpoſition of thoſe Kings, ſaith <hi>Tellezius.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he behav'd himſelf with an undaunted Courage in all ſorts of Danger: For he had hardly graſp'd the Helm of Government in his hands, when the <hi>Gallans</hi> underſtanding the Diviſions at Court fell into <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> with three Armies, and overthrew the Governor of <hi>Gojam,</hi> who preſum'd to fight againſt the King's Command, whereupon the King ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving ſoon after, leading an Army tir'd by a long March, with a greater Courage than Force, he aſſail'd the Enemy; who pufft up with Victory, bore down the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> with ſo much Violence, that the Captains finding their Battalions recoil, perſwaded the King to betake himſelf to an early flight. When he, diſdaining the motion, as arguing Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, leapt from his Horſe, and advancing with his Sword and Buckler, cry'd out, <hi>Here will I die; you if you pleaſe, may flye; perhaps you may eſcape the fury of the</hi> Gallans, <hi>but never the Infamy of deſerting your King.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59633:77"/>The <hi>Habeſsines</hi> mov'd with ſuch a Speech, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Prince, caſt themſelves into a Globe, and with a Prodigious fury, like Men prepar'd to dye, broke in among the <hi>Gallans,</hi> and conſtrain'd them to give back; which the Fugitives perceiving preſently return'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Fight, gain'd a glorious Victory with ſuch a Slaughter of the Enemy, that a greater had not been made among them at any other time. The King believing that the Advantages of ſuch a Victory were not to be let ſlip, did not indulge himſelf to be as ſoon overcome with Banquets and Luxury, under pretence of Refreſhment, but with a ſwift March, led his Army over Mountains and Rocks, againſt the other Body of the Enemy, which with the ſame ſucceſs he put to Flight; The third Army, not daring to withſtand the force of the <hi>Habeſsine,</hi> retreated into the Faſtneſſes of their Country. Of theſe, Four hundred thought themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure with their Prey, in a ſteep, and almoſt inacceſſible Mountain. But the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> now contemning their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, already terrify'd with the Slaughter of their own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; couragiouſly drave them from their Holds, and ſlew them every Mothers Son.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time <hi>Peter Pays</hi> a Jeſuit, arriving in <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſsinia,</hi> at the Requeſt of the King went to Court, and ſo oblig'd him with ſeveral Diſcourſes concerning Matters as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, that at firſt privately, then publickly he embrac'd the <hi>Latin</hi> Religion, which he teſtify'd by Letters as well to the Pope, as to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> then <hi>Philip</hi> the Third; and preferr'd the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> before his own <hi>Habeſsinians.</hi> But this ſame Kindneſs of his to Strangers, and a Foreign Religion, begat him the Hatred of his People, and caus'd his own Deſtruction. For the Nobility of the Kingdom took it in great diſdain to ſee their Ancient Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion chang'd, and that the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſhould be deſerted: And they were the more enflam'd out of their Envy to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and the Rancour which they bore to <hi>Laeca-Marjam,</hi> the King's principal Friend. Therefore they Conſpire againſt him among themſelves. The Head of the Faction was one <hi>Saſlac,</hi> born of mean Parentage, but of great fame for his Experience in War, and for that reaſon proud. He was exil'd by <hi>Jacob,</hi> but recall'd by <hi>Za-Denghel,</hi> and made Governor of <hi>Dembea;</hi> conſequently ungrateful, and out of an inbred Stubborneſs, frowardly diſdaining Obedience. <hi>Ras-Athanaſius</hi>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59633:77"/>
was drawn into this Society, a famous Captain, and a Man of great Conduct; and being firſt in Dignity, frown'd to ſee that he was but Second in the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and therefore he proves a Traitor to a moſt excellent King, as one that had forgot who ſet the Crown upon his Head. But the Cauſe of Religion was the main pretence; the moſt prevalent to put the Minds of People into diſorder: for they were not ignorant what Preparations were making at Court for the introducing of the <hi>Latin</hi> Religion. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Complaints were therefore divulg'd abroad, <hi>That the King was Revolted from the Church of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>the Common Mother Church: and that there was nothing intended by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſcourſes and familiarity with the Jeſuits, but the Abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inſtitutions of their Ancestors, and the Introduction of new Ceremonies and Foreign Prieſts into the Kingdom. That the</hi> Portugals <hi>would come in and eſtabliſh their Religion by force of Arms; and when they had done that, would endeavour alſo to take the Kingdom from them. That it behov'd them to ſuccour their Diſtreſſed Countrey, and that ſuch a King was not to be endur'd, who had firſt deſerted the True Worſhip of God.</hi> Theſe things were eaſily inculcated into thoſe that were of the ſame mind before. But there was nothing which alienated ſo much the minds of the People, as that the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had been heard to ſay, <hi>That the Reduction,</hi> ſo they call'd the <hi>Converſion of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>was but vainly attempted, if it could not be upheld by force of Arms.</hi> The King, having detected the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, calls the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> together, confiding in them, as Foreigners and Men of the <hi>Latin</hi> Religion: then marching with all ſpeed toward <hi>Gojam,</hi> he was deſerted by the way, firſt by <hi>Ras-Athanaſius,</hi> whom tho he ſuſpected, he durſt not apprehend; then by <hi>Jonael,</hi> one of his Principal Captains. Their example many others following, forſake the King. The King ſeeing himſelf left with a ſlender Guard, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to <hi>Peter Pays,</hi> ſpoke theſe words, <hi>This therefore befalls me, becauſe I am deſirous to ſhew them the way of Truth, and to ſet free the Weak from the Oppreſsion of the more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Commander of the <hi>Portugueſes, John Gabriel,</hi> advis'd him <hi>to Protract the War, till the heat of the Rebels fury waxed cool; that his Friends with his Innocent Subjects would repair to his Aſsiſtance; that the reſt would in time come to themſelves, and repent their folly: That Sedition was like a Torrent, violent at firſt, but that it abated by degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:59633:78"/>But the King impatient of delay, look'd upon Protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as a Diminution of his Honour; and being too full of Courage, and in his boyling Youth, reſolv'd to try the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of War, that rarely accompanies raſhneſs, before the Rebels ſhould encreaſe their Numbers. So he Marches with a ſmall Army of ſcarce Twelve thouſand Men, thinking to fall upon them e're they were aware of his coming. This over-haſtineſs had but ill ſucceſs. For moſt of his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were Men experienc'd in War, who did not follow their buſineſs negligently; and beſides they were as eager to come to a Field deciſion, before the King ſhould gather Strength.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Enemies of the new Religion Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz'd together from all Parts; and among the reſt <hi>Abuna Peter,</hi> the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Metropolitan, and chief Head of the Rebellion; who by an unheard of Preſident in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God and Man, abſolv'd the Rebels from the tye of their Oaths which they had Sworn to their lawful Prince, which they themſelves had already broke, by virtue of a deteſtable Excommunication of his Prince. Thus more and more embold'nd, and contemning the Majeſty of the King, they turn'd their Veneration into Hatred. And ſo with mutual Animoſity they joyn Battel. The <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who fought in the right wing, maintain'd their ground a long time, believing the Kings and the Cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be their own. But in the left Wing, of which the King himſelf took charge, all things went to rack; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fled over to the Enemy, many look'd on without ſtriking a ſtroke, reſolv'd to follow the Fortune of the Day. Thus the King forſaken by his own, fought bravely for a long time, till <hi>Laeca-Marjam,</hi> and the reſt of his Guard being ſlain, he was himſelf ſtruck down from his Horſe with the ſling of a Lance. After that getting up again to renew the Fight, he was ſtuck through the body, and ſlain with ſeveral Darts thrown at a diſtance; reverence of his perſon not permitting them to come near to hurt him. The third day after the Fight, he was taken up and buried without any Funeral Pomp in a little Chappel hard by the Field of the Battel. Such was the end of the ſhort Life and Reign of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Lawful King of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> A doleful Warning to admoniſh us, that the Cauſe of Religion ought to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and prudently handled. And that it behoves a Prince
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59633:78"/>
not to thruſt himſelf raſhly into a Battel, eſpecially when there is no certain Succeſſor. For proof whereof, the fatal Example of <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> may ſerve among the reſt.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>KIng <hi>Zadenghel</hi> being thus ſlain, the War indeed ceas'd, yet Peace did not preſently enſue. For the Rebels not dreaming of ſuch a ſpeedy Victory, had not conſider'd of a Succeſſor. Wherefore, as it were ſtupid with Emulation, <hi>Ras-Athanaſius</hi> departs for <hi>Gojam,</hi> and <hi>Zaſlac</hi> for <hi>Dembea,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever holding any common Conſultation. Thereupon <hi>Suſneus,</hi> hearing of the King's death, and believing that the Kingdom was now fallen to Him, as being the Son of <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and Grandchild of <hi>David;</hi> and then being alſo a Young man, train'd up in the <hi>Gallan</hi> Wars, belov'd and ſurrounded with the choiceſt of the Military Bands, he conceiv'd no ſmall hopes of his deſign. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſends before one of the Faithfulleſt of his Friends to <hi>Ras-Athanaſius,</hi> with inſtructions to declare to him in ſhort, <hi>That whereas the Kingdom belong'd to him by right of Inheritance, he ſhould come preſently and joyn Forces with his.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Suſneus,</hi> not expecting an Anſwer, follows the Meſſenger with the nimbleſt of his Army, and writes to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> as if
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59633:79"/>
already made King, <hi>That he was at hand, and that therefore he ſhould come to meet him and pay him the accustom'd honours due to him. Athanaſius</hi> amaz'd at the unexpected approach of <hi>Suſneus,</hi> void of Counſel, the Danger being Equal on both ſides, either to refuſe or admit him, at length, finding all aſſiſtance far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and no hopes of delay, to give him time to conſult with <hi>Zaslac,</hi> he rather choſe to be before-hand with the new King's Favours, than to hazard the uncertain Fortune of a Battel. So that <hi>Suſneus,</hi> being honourably receiv'd into the Camp, was ſaluted <hi>King.</hi> Which done, he preſently writes to <hi>Zaſlac, That by the Providence of God he had recovered the Throne of his Anceſtors; and was now marching for</hi> Dembea: <hi>therefore he ſhould take Care that there might be Forces there ready to receive him, and thoſe deſerved Favours which he was ready to beſtow upon them.</hi> But he, tho aſtoniſh'd at the ſuddain News, was unwilling to acknowledg him for King, whom he had not made himſelf; and therefore conſulting with his Friends, return'd for anſwer, <hi>That he would then obey him, if</hi> Jacob, <hi>to whom he had already by Meſſage offer'd the Kingdom, did not come before</hi> June; <hi>and therefore begg'd that ſhort delay. Suſneus,</hi> no way pleas'd with the Condition, wrote back to him again, <hi>That he was King already, and therefore would give place neither to</hi> Jacob, <hi>once before adjudg'd unworthy, nor to his Father</hi> Malec-Saghed, <hi>though he ſhould return from the other World. Zaſlac,</hi> having receiv'd this ſurly Anſwer, equally mettleſom and diligent, turns his Arms upon him, and comes on briskly to meet him. <hi>Suſneus</hi> finding himſelf prevented with the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy March of his Adverſary, and perceiving himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match'd, and, which was worſe, not well in health, retir'd to the Craggy Mountains of <hi>Amhara. Ras-Athanaſius</hi> alſo, whoſe precipitancy <hi>Zaſlac</hi> had upbraided, retreated into other Faſtneſſes to avoid the Fury of his Aſſociate. In the mean time there being no News of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the other Captains and Commanders of the Army began to ſcatterwords of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>That they would not be without a King, that if</hi> Jacob <hi>would not come, there was no Perſon fitter than</hi> Suſneus, <hi>neither would he be at reſt, till he had obtain'd by force, what they would not give him by fair means. Zaslac,</hi> fearing the Inconſtancy of his own People, and conſequently a Revolt, orders Commiſſioners to be ſent; and by them ſurrenders the Scepter to <hi>Suſneus,</hi> who preſently ſent a Perſon to whom Allegiance ſhould be ſworn in his Name. Which being done, Ten of the chiefeſt Peers ride forth to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59633:79"/>
meet the new King, and to conduct him with a Pomp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting into the Camp. And now Shouts and Acclamations are to be every where heard. Neither were Banquets want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with all other Solemnities uſual at the Inaugurations of their Kings; when on a ſudden new Commiſſioners from <hi>Jacob,</hi> quite diſturb'd their mirth, with ſuch a ſuddain altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as with which Fortune never more odly mock'd before the hopes of thoſe that thought themſelves in the poſſeſſion of a Throne. For <hi>Jacob</hi> twice Depos'd, twice reſtor'd, between the Higheſt and the Loweſt, (which is moſt rare) had twice Experience of the Mean betwixt both. While the Promoters of theſe Troubles exercis'd their Hatred and their Love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of puniſhment, that one might think it the ſport of Scenes, rather than a ſerious poſſeſſion of Royalty. For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly <hi>Zaſlac,</hi> without any heſitation, rode forth to meet <hi>Jacoh,</hi> as if he had bin <hi>Suſneus</hi> himſelf, to whom he had but juſt before ſworn Fidelity, and receiv'd him with the uſual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours due to <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Majeſty, and with his whole Army ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him King, the Commiſſioners, ſent to <hi>Suſneus,</hi> being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately recall'd. <hi>Suſneus,</hi> knowing Time was to be watch'd, once more gave way to Fortune, and retir'd to his former lurking holes, and hid himſelf again in the Natural Fortreſſes of <hi>Amhara.</hi> For he had learnt from the Example of <hi>Zaden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghel,</hi> to give way to Popular Heats and Tumults, till they cool'd of themſelves: for that the People after their firſt Paſſions are ſpent, reſume their former Modeſty, and return repenting to their duty. <hi>Ras-Athanaſius</hi> alſo, tho ſo great a Perſon, yet accuſtom'd to follow Fortune, rather than his Faith, he, I ſay, with the ſame Eaſineſs that he had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd <hi>Suſneus,</hi> fell at the feet of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Jacob,</hi> did not think it prudent to ſuffer a Rival in his Dignity, and therefore reſolving to try what might be done by way of agreement, he commanded <hi>Suſneus</hi>'s Mother to go to her Son, and offer him the Kingdoms of <hi>Amhara, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leka,</hi> and <hi>Shewa,</hi> as alſo all the Lands which his Father poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd, and he had hitherto claim'd in vain. But <hi>Suſneus</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lofty Soul, deny'd, <hi>That what he had receiv'd by the Gift of God, could be taken from him by Men. That the whole Kingdom was his due, which he would not relinquiſh but with his Life; That</hi> Jacob <hi>would deal with more Juſtice and Uprightneſs, to quit his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, than to haſten Ruin to himſelf and his Countrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:59633:80"/>This haughty anſwer being deliver'd, <hi>Jacob</hi> decreed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the buſineſs not with Meſſages, but by the Sword. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Suſneus</hi> Expert at delays, by the aſſiſtance of the Rocks and Mountains, avoyded the purſuit of <hi>Jacob,</hi> watching for thoſe Opportunities which ſoon after preſented themſelves. For <hi>Zaſlac,</hi> whether out of a vain-glory to behold the Event of the Battel, or out of any private Indignation, did not joyn his Forces with <hi>Jacob;</hi> but on the contrary, and as it were in deſpight of Military diſcipline, acted all things careleſly and remiſsly; believing his fame a Terror ſufficient to the Enemy. This was not conceal'd from <hi>Suſneus,</hi> who taking a ſhorter way came upon <hi>Zaſlac</hi> ſo of a ſuddain, that his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had not time to handle their Arms, much leſs to put themſelves into order: ſo that they were ſlain like ſheep, and utterly routed, and <hi>Zaſlac,</hi> having loſt his Army, was forc'd to entruſt his Safety to an ignominoous flight. Which Victory as it dejected <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Friends, ſo it rais'd the ſpirits of <hi>Suſneus</hi>'s Party. <hi>Zaſlac</hi> himſelf had loſt the Kings favour, and began to be ſuſpected. Thus the buſineſs began to work; for <hi>Zaſlac</hi> jealous of theſe diſparagements, notwithſtanding <hi>Jacob</hi> had heap'd ſo many favours upon him, for he had created him <hi>Legate Royal,</hi> began to Enter into a Correſpondence with <hi>Suſneus,</hi> uſing Treachery as the hire of thoſe that valu'd him moſt. <hi>Suſneus</hi> ſtanding in need of his Power, accepted his Propoſitions, and diſſembling his Hatred, made him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate in the War, to leſſen the force of his Enemy. <hi>Jacob</hi> hearing of his Revolt, judging that it behov'd him to make haſt, before the reſt ſhould follow his Example, reſolv'd to put it to the hazard of a Battel; well knowing that he far exceeded <hi>Suſneus</hi> in number of men: nor did <hi>Suſneus</hi> refuſe him, tho inferior: however, he cunningly kept the rough and hilly Grounds, watching like a Lyon when to take his fatal jump.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy judging his delay to proceed from his fear, and confiding in their multitude, began to act more daringly, and to provoke <hi>Suſneus</hi> with upbraiding Language, until he had brought them into a narrow place where he could not be ſurrounded by his Enemies. Then Exhorting his Souldiers, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the day is come, that You may make me King of</hi> Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia: <hi>and for Your ſelves, You are to be either Maſters or Slaves, as You behave Your ſelves. I will not be onely the Companion of Your
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59633:80"/>
Victory, but your Dangers: Victory is in your own power, ſo that you do not turn your backs to your Enemies, before you ſee me begin to flye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus Encourag'd his Souldiers, he gave the Signal of Battel. Which ſeen, they gave ſo furious an Onſett, that the Enemy was every where beaten down, without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, amaz'd and aſtoniſh'd, to be ſo ſubdu'd by thoſe whom they reck'ned for fugitives. The ſlaughter was great, with little loſs on <hi>Suſneus</hi>'s ſide. <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Abuna-Peter,</hi> who had in vain thunder'd out his Anathema's againſt the Enemy, were both ſlain. Which <hi>Suſneus</hi> underſtanding, ſounded a retreat, that by his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to the Common Soldiery and his own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he might win to himſelf the Reputation of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, neceſſary for the Eſtabliſhment of a New Prince.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch was the Terror that poſſeſſed the hearts of the <hi>Jacobeans,</hi> forc'd on by the croud of Fugitives, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Country, tho there was no purſuit, that they threw themſelves headlong in the night time from a Rock diſmally ſteep and cragged. Among the reſt, there was a certain Portugueſe, by name <hi>Emanuel-Gonſalvo,</hi> who betimes perceiving his Horſe as it were flying in the Air, quitting his Stirrups, left him, and taking hold by chance of the branch of a Tree, made a ſhift to recover a Seat in the bough, where he ſate all night. Nor did he well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his danger, till day appearing, he diſcovered, not without horror, at a prodigious diſtance underneath him, a vaſt heap of Men and Horſes with their Limbs and Members broken all to flitters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suſneus</hi> having obtain'd ſo great a Victory, exercis'd no ſo ſort of Severity or Reveng againſt any Perſon; only <hi>Maharhin</hi> he commanded to be beheaded, as being a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſect of <hi>Iſlamiſm,</hi> and the Perſon that had firſt wounded <hi>Zadenghel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that he departed for <hi>Coga,</hi> there to, ſettle the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Kingdom, where <hi>Zaſlac</hi> whom he could not endure to ſee, was ſtill in his Eye, the grand promoter of all theſe troubles. He was the firſt that went over to <hi>Suſneus</hi>'s Party, and therefore was look't upon by <hi>Suſneus</hi> as one that would be conſtantly caſting in his Diſh the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he had done, and pride himſelf to be the ſetter up of kings. And indeed in one of his vain-glorious humors, of

which deſerving Soldiers are generally too much guilty, he had unwarily given out, That it was foretold him, <hi>That he ſhould pull down three Kings, which was fulfill'd in Two.</hi> So that the New King ſeem'd only to be wanting for the third. It being therefore a Maxim, <hi>That jealouſie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cannot long remain in one and the ſame Breſt, and that the fruit of Treaſon being reap'd, there is no farther need of the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> the King commanded him to be apprehended and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into the ſteep Mountain of <hi>Gueman,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Gojam.</hi> He would not put him to death, as not believing it became a noble Prince to take away a mans life for fear of a future crime. But he making his Eſcape, about a year after, invaded <hi>Waleka,</hi> where having gather'd together ſome Troops of Vagabonds and diſſolute Perſons, he ſupported himſelf by Robbery and Rapine; till at laſt, making his Incurſions into <hi>Gojam,</hi> he was there ſlain by the <hi>Pagans.</hi> His head being brought to the King, was fix'd upon a Lance, and ſet up before the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pavillion, to be view'd by all the World; no man pitying his misfortune, in regard that all people knew his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had coſt the loſs of ſo many innocent lives.</p>

Some there were, that acknowledg'd they both knew and ſaw the dead body of King <hi>Jacob,</hi> after the blood was wip'd away, but no man durſt aſſert himſelf to be the Perſon that kill'd him.

So that he not being able himſelf to quell the Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the King was forc'd to advance himſelf. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels having intelligence of his coming, fled ſeveral ways, to avoyd fighting. Their Captain, with only four of his Aſſociates, and ſome few Goats, which he carry'd with him for their milks ſake, ſecur'd themſelves by a painful Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage through the moſt wild and uncouth concealments of Nature, that the Rocks could afford him, where it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to trace him. So that the King diſpairing, after a tedious ſearch, to find him out, return'd to <hi>Dembea,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſolemniz'd his Inauguration at <hi>Axuma,</hi> after the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

He ſwore obedience to the Pope; before he had weigh'd what benefit he might get by it.

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Royal Succeſſion, and the Impriſonment of the Kings Children in the Rock <hi>Geſhen,</hi> now quite out of uſe.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Certain Succeſſion the Safety of Kingdoms. Two Bonds of Government. How far Prudence, how far Nobility and Power prevail. Election not alwayes to be preferr'd before Succeſſion: more agreeable to Liberty. The Males only ſucceed in <hi>Abaſſia.</hi> Their Claim dubious: hence Wars. The Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of Hereditary Kingdoms. The ill Events of uncertain Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Impriſonment of the Kings Children. <hi>Tellezius</hi>'s Relation of it. The Cuſtom for <hi>300</hi> Years, abrogated by <hi>Naod. Alvarez</hi>'s Relation: it diſagrees with <hi>Tellezius:</hi> reconcil'd: No preſident for half a Century. The pleaſantneſs of thoſe Rocks fabulous. The ſevere uſage of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there. The ſeverity of the Governour diſpleaſing to the Prince: pleas'd him when King.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FRom what has bin ſaid, it appears that the Succeſſion of the Kings of <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> is uncertain; and that there is no great difference made between the Legitimate and he Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate. However, the moſt aſſured Safety of Kingdoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Conſtant and Eſtabliſh'd Settlement of Succeſſion But if in Hereditary Kingdoms, it may be lawful either for the King to chooſe one of his Sons; or if it may be lawful for the Nobility, not ſo much to regard the order of birth, as the diſpoſition and conditions of him that is to govern, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the favour of the People, War and Sedition muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow.</p>
                  <p>They that are ſet aſide will never be quiet; nor ſhall they want Factious Abettors and Aſſociates. The Grand Pretence, more Eſpecially in Elective Kingdoms, is this, <hi>That Conditions cannot be diſtinguiſh'd by Nativities; but the best may be taken by Election and Judgment.</hi> A ſpecious pretence in words, but vain in Reality; while the Imbecility of human Nature prevails, which is guided by the affections, and obeys rather Favour and Hatred, than Virtue; which uſually happens in great Aſſemblies. But there are two Pillars which ſuſtain the Safety of great Monarchies, Reverence and Authority, which they that Govern never can reconcile to themſelves either by Wiſdom or Probity alone. For there are many who
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59633:86"/>
will eſteem themſelves if not their Superiors, yet their Equals: and men very unwillingly obey their Equals, much leſs their Inferiours: ſo that it is altogether vain and pedantic, what <hi>Plato</hi> writes concerning the Felicity of Kingdoms, <hi>That they ſhould be Govern'd by Philoſophers,</hi> while other Aids are wanting. A Philoſopher, how wiſe ſoever, would hardly find a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that would obey him three days together for his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophies ſake. There ought to be ſomething External and Viſible, which as well the vulgar and ordinary ſort, as the prudent, Equally acknowledg, which is not ſubjected to the fluctuating and inconſtant determination of Men. For this reaſon in the Election of Kings and Princes, <hi>Nobility</hi> and Power are preferr'd before Wiſdom and Sanctity of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet the one requires the aſſiſtance of the other. The one is the cauſe that the Subject willingly and freely obeys; the other compels the refractory to ſubmit. And therefore becauſe Election does not bring much more advantage to a Kingdom, than the chance of birth, but is rather liable to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Seditions, many People have<note n="(m)" place="bottom">The <hi>Swedes</hi> in the laſt Century. The <hi>Danes</hi> in our memory; The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> of old. <hi>Joh. Newhoft.</hi> Deſcript. <hi>Chin.</hi> c. 18.</note> abandon'd it of their own accord. However, it approaches neareſt to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, becauſe the Electors may preſcribe Laws and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Government to the Perſon that is to be Elected; tho that ſame warineſs proves many times ineffectual: Becauſe the Prince, upon refuſal, either poſitively cannot, or elſe will be very unwilling to be brought to an accompt. So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is, that there ſhould be a compleat happineſs in this World. And therefore it is the part of a good and prudent Stateſman to prefer that form of Government which he finds <note n="(n)" place="bottom">That the Wiſe call <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But I return to the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> among whom there is this moſt prudent Conſtitution, That only the Male Iſſue ſhall govern, or the Male kindred neareſt in blood; But becauſe the Determination of the Fathers and Mothers, and the chief Nobility happens frequently to be intermix'd; and that the natural Iſſue is likewiſe, if male, allow'd the ſame Priviledge for want of Legitimate Off-ſpring: hence it comes to paſs,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59633:86"/>
that their Succeſſions are moſt unhappy and turbulent; the chief cauſe of all their Calamities.</p>
                  <p>We have already declar'd, how <hi>Helena,</hi> with the conſent of <hi>Marc</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> preferr'd <hi>David</hi> the ſecond Son before <hi>Naod</hi> the Elder Brother, as having nothing elſe to advance him but a meer brutiſh ſtrength. The Civil Wars between <hi>Menas</hi> and <hi>Tazcar</hi> his Brothers Eldeſt Son; between the Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Son of <hi>Malec-Saghed,</hi> and <hi>Zadenghel</hi> his Legitimate Kinsman; and laſtly, between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Suſneus,</hi> and all about the doubtful right of Succeſſion, are ſufficient Arguments to prove what we aſſert. <hi>Tellezius</hi> indeed declares, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lawes of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the natural Sons do not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. But in another place, he ſo diſcourſes concerning their Law, alledging the Example of <hi>John</hi> the Firſt, King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> that the Reader may perceive, that he varies in this, from his other Relation. But the chiefeſt Inconvenience which uſes to ariſe in hereditary Kingdoms, where the Succeſſion is ty'd to a certain Family, proceeds either from the ſence of Rivalſhip and a jealouſie which they that rule have of them that are nearly related in blood; or from their Ambition, which always animates the Factious. Diſmal are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> where there are no Laws or Rules for Succeſſion, but all things are at the Will of them that bear ſway, or elſe of Fortune her ſelf. What ruin'd the Family of the <hi>Caeſars?</hi> What the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire? but onely that the Creation of the Emperors was inconſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd, and at the Will of the Souldiery. Certainly it was a great Overſight in <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> after he had vanquiſh'd all his Rivals, and had all the Power in his own hands, that he ordain'd no certain Settlement of Succeſſion. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to prevent the Crimes of their Brothers, more impiouſly put them to death, and puniſh that Diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which perhaps was never intended. The Ancient Kings of <hi>Abeſsinia,</hi> to rid themſelves of theſe Fears, were wont to ſhut up their Brothers under ſafe Cuſtody, where they might abide unknown to turbulent Spirits; and ſo be uncapable of attempting any thing againſt the raigning Prince; and yet be ready to ſupply the want of Succeſſors. The Rocks of <hi>Geſhen</hi> and <hi>Ambaſel</hi> were ſet apart to this end. The whole Story from the Relations of <hi>Antonie d' Almeyda</hi> runs thus. The Emperour <hi>Icon Imlac</hi> had five Sons (others ſay nine) which he lov'd all alike. Out of which affection he moſt imprudently
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59633:87"/>
advis'd them to raign all with Equal Power; or which was worſe, to govern by turns. The Youngeſt impatient of the delay of ſo many Years, deſign'd with himſelf not to part with the Scepter, when once he had got it into his hands, but to ſend away his Brothers to ſome diſtant Rock, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Kingdom to his own Poſterity. But being betrayd by one of his peculiar Friends, who rather choſe to accept of a reward from the raigning Prince, than to expect a guerdon from him that was to raign, he was taken in the ſame ſnare which he had laid for his Brothers, and ſent to the Rock <hi>Geſhen.</hi> But leſt the King might ſeem to have conſulted more for his own than the Security of the Kingdom, he alſo ſhut up all his own Sons, which he then had, in the ſame place. After which this Cuſtom continu'd as a Fundamental Law in <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> for above Two hundred and thirty Years, by which means the raigning Kings were ſecur'd from danger of Civil Wars among Brethren; till in the Year 1590, at what time King <hi>Naod</hi> was ſent for from the Rock to aſcend the Throne. He had a Son, about Nine years of Age, whom he dearly lov'd; which Child, one of his chief Courtiers ſteadfaſtly beholding, <hi>Certainly,</hi> ſaid he to the King, <hi>this Child grows apace.</hi> The Boy was of an acute Witt, and underſtood what the Courtier drove at, and therefore fixing his weeping Eyes upon his Fathers Face, <hi>Oh Father,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Have I grown thus faſt, to be hurry'd from your ſight to the Rock</hi> Geſhen? Which word ſtrook his Father ſo deeply to the heart, that having aſſembl'd the Nobility of his Court and Kingdom, he told them, <hi>That ſuch a wicked and inhuman Cuſtom was to be renounc'd.</hi> Which was immediatly done, neither he nor his Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that private affections are not to be preferr'd before the Safety of a Nation. And thus it came to paſs, through the Kings unſeaſonable tenderneſs, that this ſame Cuſtome receiv'd and continu'd in <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> ſo much to the Health of the Government, was abrogated to the unſpeakable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom: And from that time never any Prince was Exil'd to thoſe Rocks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alvarez</hi> writes, <hi>That</hi> David <hi>being advanc'd to the Throne, his Younger Brother, with the reſt of the Sons of</hi> Naod, <hi>were ſent away to the Rock;</hi> and afterwards, <hi>That one of the Younger Sons Eſcap'd, but was taken and ſent back; and that he ſaw him there.</hi> From whence it may be objected againſt <hi>Tellezius,</hi> That this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome continu'd after <hi>Naod</hi>'s time. But we have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59633:87"/>
to believe, That he foreſaw this Objection, becauſe he binds it with an Aſſeveration, ſaying, <hi>The thing is certainly true, and is eaſie to be confirm'd as well by the Fathers of the Society, as by the Example of</hi> Suſneus, <hi>who tho he had ſeveral Sons, yet never went about to ſend any of them to the Rock.</hi> But then again when he ſayes <hi>Alvarez</hi> is to be believ'd in all things that he ſaw, there is ſome need of Reconciliation: That is to ſay, That the Sons of <hi>Naod,</hi> the Brothers of <hi>David,</hi> were then carry'd to the Rock, and that one of them after an Eſcape was taken and ſent back. So that the new Conſtitution might not help them, tho it were a kindneſs to the Sons of the ſucceeding Kings. The Reports concerning the Pleaſantneſs of thoſe Rocks, and the ſplendid attendance upon thoſe Royal Exiles, are all ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Falſities. The Rocks we have deſcrib'd already. And as for the ſplendidneſs of Attendance, when the Cuſtome was in force, moſt certain it is, that thoſe Princes were kept cloſe Priſoners, and they that either attempted to Eſcape, or were aſſiſting to their Eſcape, lay under great Penalties. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves were harſhly us'd; Neither was any perſon permitted to come at them, ſo that their Education could never fit them for a Crown, but was rather to put them out of Hopes of having any thing to do with the Affairs of this World.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of one of the Keepers, that one morning ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving one of his Royal Priſoners putting on a Garment ſomewhat neater than ordinary, he not only chidd him, and tore the Veſtment, but gave notice of it to his Father: all which the poor Prince was forc'd to take patiently. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſame Prince coming to be King himſelf, did not onely forbear to revenge the Injury, but hearing that his Keeper was gone aſide, as dreading ſome heavy puniſhment, caus'd him to be ſought out, and being brought before him half dead for fear, both prais'd and rewarded him; Exhorting him to continue in his Office as Faithful to Him, as he had bin to the King deceas'd. And thus we generally impoſe upon others, what we are very unwilling to endure our ſelves.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Priviledge and Power of the King in Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Affairs.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The Kings Power abſolute: Experienc'd by the Jeſuits. <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the Patriarch offends the King. He claims the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction. He abrogates the Latin Religion; calls Synods: He forbears the right of Nomination: not bound by the Secular Laws. He has no Eſtates. The benefit of them: He enjoyes all Royal Priviledges, but makes not uſe of all: Hunting Lawful for all. Private perſons have nothing proper. The King takes and gives as he pleaſes: Certain Families excepted.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Power of the <hi>Abeſsinian</hi> Kings is abſolute, as well in Eccleſiaſtical as Civil Affairs. Of which the Fathers of the Society have had ſufficient experience; in whoſe favour, and to whoſe diſadvantage he has exercis'd his ſupream Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Authority, without ever conſulting the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> Firſt when he put forth ſeveral Edicts, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and abrogating the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Ceremonies: which was done with the conſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Afterwards the ſtate of Affairs changing, when he diſpenc'd by public Edict with certain Ceremonies that were indifferent, <hi>Alfonſus</hi> the Patriarch reprov'd him. <hi>It is not lawful,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for a King to put forth any ſuch Edict, as being purely Eccleſiaſtical, and belonging to the Priestly Office: and You ought to remember what the High Prieſt ſaid to King</hi> Uzziah. <hi>It belongs not to thee, O King</hi> Uzziah, <hi>to offer incenſe to the Lord, but to the Prieſts, the Sons of</hi> Aaron, <hi>who are conſecrated to that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, get thee forth out of the Sanctuary, for it will not be imputed to thee as an honour by the Lord God;</hi> to which the Patriarch added the Puniſhment that follow'd. The King for that time gave way to the Patriarch, and publiſh'd the Edict in another manner and form. But not brooking the Compariſon made between him and <hi>Uzziah,</hi> among other things he gave the Patriarch this anſwer. <hi>Wherefore didſt thou bid us be mindful of</hi> Uzziah, <hi>and wherefore didſt thou compare us with him? He was therefore puniſh'd by God, for uſurping the Office of the Prieſt which did not become him; and becauſe he offer'd Incenſe and Sacrifice to God, which We never attempted to do: onely We commanded an Edict
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59633:88"/>
to be publiſh'd about thoſe Indifferent things which were agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Us both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing more incens'd the King, but that he ſaw his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative call'd in queſtion, which for ſo many Ages had bin enjoy'd by his Anceſtors, and which was never deny'd by the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> even before the Schiſme. Nor was he ignorant what the ancient Emperours after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had done in the ſame Caſes. Nor was he ſo dull of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as not to be able to diſtinguiſh between Epiſcopal rules, and Kingly Juriſdiction, which he thought belong'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Which Prerogative, tho he had a great Reverence for the Patriarch, he would not part with, but rather choſe to publiſh another Edict, which tended manifeſtly to the Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Patriarchal Power. For the Patriarch had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a certain Monk to give ſome part of his Eccleſiaſtical Revenues to a certain Pariſh. The Monk would not obey; but complain'd to his Superiour, one <hi>Iceg,</hi> who obtain'd a Decree from the King, wherein the Patriarch was enjoyn'd to keep to the Rules of the Metropolitans of Ancient <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and that <hi>Iceg</hi> ſhould enjoy his due Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>His Prerogative in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs was moſt apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made manifeſt, by the making of that ſevere Decree for the abrogating the Latin Worſhip, and reſtoring that of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Moreover, the King ſummons the Synods of the Clergy, as often as need requires; he ſends for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> exerciſing plenary Juriſdiction over him and all the reſt of his Clergy: and puniſhing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of their Offences, which the Examples recited by <hi>Alvarez,</hi> ſufficiently demonſtrate. In one thing however he differs from our <hi>European</hi> Kings, that he never nominates to Eccleſiaſtical Benefices. For the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſends a Metropolitan, at the requeſt of the King indeed; but he knows not who or what he is. He alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Patriarch, whom the Pope ſent, tho not he but the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> nam'd him.</p>
                  <p>Neither are there in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> any other Eccleſiaſtical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; and therefore the Prerogative of nominating Biſhops and Archbiſhops, ſignifies little or nothing. In Seculars he acknowledges no poſitive Laws. And well it were that he did not think himſelf alſo altogether free from the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59633:89"/>
Laws of his Realm, upon which the Safety of the Kingdom depends.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Naod</hi> diſpenc'd with the wholeſome Conſtitutions of his Anceſtors, by vertue of which the Kings Children were ſent to the Rock of <hi>Amhara.</hi> And <hi>Malec-Saghed</hi> would have preferr'd his natural Son <hi>Jacob</hi> before his Brothers Legitimate Son <hi>Zadenghel;</hi> both which prov'd very diſadvantagious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents to the whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch things frequently come to paſs, where the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is without Eſtates. For they are the moſt Truſty Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Law, and the true Bulwarks of the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty againſt the Encroachments of the Ambitious. For they have a more vigilant eye and tender care over the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, of which they are themſelves Members, than the Friends of Princes, whoſe Fortunes hardly deſcend to their Heirs; ſo that a man may admire at their Counſels, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Priviledges of <hi>Eſtates,</hi> endeavour to aſſume the whole Power into their own hands, as deeming every ſlight bond of the Law, to themſelves heavy and intollerable. So that they are forc'd to diſtribute thoſe Favours and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which are due to their fellow Citizens, among the Souldiery, whoſe fidelity is brittle and inconſtant: not caring who are poor, ſo they be rich: and many times the Souldiers turn thoſe Arms which were put into their hands for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Prince, againſt him; being put upon the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either by the Ambition or the Wealth of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon. Which in <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> as in all other abſolute Goverments, frequently happens to the deſtruction of thoſe that bear the ſway.</p>
                  <p>He has alſo the ſole diſpoſal of Peace or Warr, and indeed all the Prerogatives that a King can claim (both the greater and the leſſer <hi>Regalia</hi>) are ſolely at his devotion; tho he makes no uſe of many of them, merely becauſe he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them; as the Prerogative in reference to Metals, Coyning of Money, and the like. As for the liberty of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he grants it to all; in regard there are ſuch multitudes of Wild Beaſts that breed up and down in the over-grown Woods and high Mountains, that it is not onely troubleſome but dangerous to find out their haunts: by which means that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59633:89"/>
which in other Countries is a Pleaſure, to the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Toyl and Detriment.</p>
                  <p>One thing is much to be admir'd, and rare ev'n among the <hi>Turks,</hi> which is, that no private perſon, whether Peaſant or Lord, except ſome few can call any thing his own. All the Lands and Farms in the Country belong to the King, and are held by the Subjects onely at the Kings pleaſure, ſo that no man takes it amiſs, if the King takes away their Lands and beſtowes them upon another as he pleaſes himſelf; and that not onely after two or three years, but alſo the ſame year they were given: So that it often happens that one man ploughs, and another man ſowes. Whence it comes to paſs, that they are more ſubmiſſive to their Kings, then a Servant to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or a Vaſſal to his Lord: they ſerve him in Peace and War; and bring him Preſents according to their Ability, in hopes of obtaining new Farms, or for fear of loſing thoſe they have. For being commanded out of poſſeſſion, they never grumble, but preſently obey without the leaſt diſtaſt againſt the King, or envy to the perſon that ſucceeds in their Room. Cuſtome and long uſe prevailing, while they ſee the ſame happening to others. However there are ſome ancient and Illuſtrious Families, eſpecially in <hi>Tigra,</hi> who enjoy by right of Inheritance not only Lands and Poſſeſſions purchas'd by their Anceſtors, but ſome certain Prefectures alſo, retaining their ancient Title; as <hi>Bahr-Nagaſh, Shum Serawè Sirè, Temben,</hi> and others; as alſo <hi>Cantiba</hi> in <hi>Dembea;</hi> over whom the King claims no other Authority, than to confer the public Employments every two year, or yearly, or as he pleaſes, upon others; yet ſo as that they be of the ſame Family.</p>

                     <p>The Power of the <hi>Habeſſine</hi> Kings formerly great; Formidable to their Neighbours; it fail'd after the <hi>Saracens</hi> came in Play.

The King has enough to ſupply him both in Peace and War.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SO great and ſo abſolute a Power, and ſo uncontroulable a Dominion over their Subjects, one would think ſhould render the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> vaſtly Potent: and ſo no doubt it would, if other things were correſpondent. Certainly of old it was vaſtly great, when they kept their Courts at<note n="(o)" place="bottom">

Which tho it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the King of <hi>Nubia,</hi> yet ſeveral Authors attribute the ſame to the King of the <hi>Abiſsines;</hi> in regard that by the <hi>Nubian</hi> Geographer, <hi>Nubia</hi>

                        <hi>Bochapts</hi> Sacred Geography l. 2. c. 23. However moſt certainly <hi>Cyriacus</hi> had another name.</note> extended to the Fountains of <hi>Nile. Gregory</hi> alſo affirm'd the ſame, and that the Hiſtory was to be ſeen in his Country. But when the <hi>Saracens</hi> grew ſtronger, and had invaded the Neighbouring Kingdoms, the <hi>Abiſsines,</hi> relinquiſhing <hi>Axuma,</hi> and turning the force of their Arms againſt the more upland parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> enlarg'd their Empire by the Overthrow of ſeveral weak and effeminate Nations, no more regarding forraign Countries, or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of far diſtant Regions: which was the reaſon that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, they perform'd nothing that was memorable abroad. However they were Potent at home, and had under them ſeveral petty-Princes that were their Tributaries. And in this Greatneſs they flouriſh'd, in the time of <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> till it was not only ſhaken by that Dreadful Warr with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delans;</hi> but ſo overturn'd, that it never could recover it ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. For about that time the <hi>Gallans</hi> alſo breaking out, and never after that ſubdu'd, layd waſt and harraſs'd the moſt Opulent and moſt Noble Provinces of the Empire: and ſtill to this day every year gain upon the reſt with their continual Incurſions. However, that Power which yet remains is ſo conſiderable, that if they would but make uſe of the Arts and Arms of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> they might not onely ſubdue thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but alſo recover their Loſt Dominions. For a Kingdom well order'd within, under ſuch a Monarch, where the People are under ſo much ſubjection; ſo large a liberty to do well or ill; if Concord and Unity attended theſe Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, together with a conſtant method of Counſels, it is impoſſible, but that they muſt ſoon prevail over a wandring Nation, divided among themſelves into ſo many Tribes and Factions. All their truculent and ſavage fury would be in vain, if the ſtreights of the Mountains were but well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59633:91"/>
and guarded with Field-Pieces. They ſhould alſo ſend forth ſeveral Colonies, and give them a taſt of the Bleſſings of Peace, by which the wildeſt of Nations oft-times grow tame. But which is more than all, and which the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> moſt earneſtly deſire, Towns ſhould be built, and repleniſh'd with people, and an increaſe of Wealth be permitted by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Arts and Arms. Laſtly, if the Kng would remit ſomething of his Prerogative which he has over the Eſtates of the Subject, and reſerving thoſe Lands which are already till'd, to himſelf, would diſtribute to his Souldiers and the reſt of his People ſuch Lands as ſhould be won from the Enemy, every one his proportion, and grant them an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable Inheritance of ſuch Lands; ſettling alſo Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Earldoms in fee-ſimple out of the Conquer'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, upon his Nobility, and beſt deſerving Captains, no doubt but in a ſhort time, it would prove the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom in <hi>Aſia,</hi> greatly to the propagation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>And it ſeems but reaſon, that in the ſettling and ordering his Kingdom, the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Prince ſhould be advis'd and aſſiſted by the <hi>European</hi> Princes, not onely out of Chriſtian Charity and hopes of propagating Chriſtianity over <hi>Africa,</hi> but alſo to leſſen the Power of the <hi>Turk,</hi> which would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, were the Dominion of the Red Sea but wreſted out of his hands, and the Commerce of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſpoyl'd. Ah! what pity it is, that we ſhould be ſo ill affected towards other Chriſtian Nations, that unleſs they are of the ſame Opinion with us in all points of Divinity; or unleſs they promiſe us large Rewards, or an ample ſhare of their Profits, we can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently look on, and ſee them periſh, while the moſt invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemies of the Chriſtian Faith are enrich'd with the ſpoyls of their Wealth; not conſidering that in the end the miſchief will redound to our ſelves: and that we ſhall one day, unleſs God in mercy prevent it, dearly pay for our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions.</p>
                  <p>Thus we forbore to aſſiſt the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Eaſtern Princes, till they became at laſt a prey to the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> Thus, while none of Us lay'd it to heart, <hi>Egypt</hi> was reduc'd under the Power of the <hi>Turk;</hi> a vaſt addition to their Empire: as if it were a Crime to breed up Doggs to hunt the Wolves. Now the reaſon why the <hi>Abiſsines</hi> do not court with greater ardour the Alliances of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> is
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59633:91"/>
plain: for it is to be attributed either to their ignorance, or their difference in Opinion from the <hi>Latines.</hi> Moreover, they fail very much in this, that they permit the <hi>Turk</hi> to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Ports and Ilands of the Red Sea, whereby it is abſolutely at their pleaſure what Perſons or Commodities ſhall paſs in and out. But they underſtand not, that there is no Nation can be truly Powerful and Great, that does not Command ſome Sea-Towns.</p>
                  <p>As for the Revenues of the King, they are not paid in ready money, but in the natural Productions of the Countries, the moſt equal ſort of Tribute. For ſome Provinces afford Gold; others Horſes, Cattel, Sheep, Corn and Ox Hides, and ſome few, where Weavers live, ſend him Garments. They bring their Gold rough and unrefin'd, as they gather it up among the Sands of the Rivers, or digg it out under the Roots of Trees, or elſe with leſs Labour find it looſe upon the Earth. For they know not how to coyn money, but after the ancient manner, weigh their Mettal, wherein they are many times gull'd by forraign Merchants, who frequently deny the Gold to be pure; and therefore change it for the meaneſt of their Commodities. How much better might the King provide for himſelf and his Subjects, ſhould he with Money of his own Coyn, buy up all the Gold in his Kingdom, to his own and the great advantage of his People. <hi>Enarea</hi>
                     <note n="(u)" place="bottom">15000 <hi>Patachs</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> or <hi>German</hi> Dollars.</note> pays a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and five hundred Ounces of Gold: formerly much more. To <hi>Suſneus</hi> it pay'd but a Thouſand, and ſometimes but Five hundred, when the <hi>Enareans</hi> were either at Wars with the <hi>Gallans,</hi> or elſe embroyl'd one with another. <hi>Gojam</hi> pays every Year Eleven hundred Ounces, and ſome Garments, to the value of 3000 <hi>German</hi> Dollars, together with Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fuſtian Tapeſtries, very broad and cloſe woven. Formerly they alſo pay'd a Tribute of Horſes, but <hi>Malec-Saghed</hi> remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that, to the end they might be the better able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Gallans.</hi> Out of <hi>Tigra</hi> he receives Five and twenty thouſand Patachs. Out of <hi>Dembea</hi> Five thouſand. As much out of other Kingdoms, or ſometimes leſs. There are alſo ſeveral <hi>Tolls</hi> pay'd, but generally granted to the Nobility for their ſubſiſtance; except thoſe of the high Mountain, <hi>Lamal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> over which all the Merchants and Merchandize muſt paſs from the Red Sea into <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> which the King reſerves
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59633:92"/>
to himſelf. He alſo has his Lands and Farms, from whence he is ſerv'd with Proviſions for his Table, ten or twelve Horſe-Loads at a time. Laſtly, <hi>Dembea, Gojam,</hi> and <hi>Bagemdra</hi> find him Corn and Fleſh. That which he receives out of <hi>Dembea</hi> is diſtributed among the Souldiers which have no Land, or elſe among the Poor. But his chief Tribute is from the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, who are bound to pay him every Tenth Oxe or Cow every Three Years: which is as much as if they ſhould pay the 30th every Year. And the whole Empire is ſo divided, that every Year he has his certain Tribute of Cows and Oxen. Beſides, every Year every Chriſtian Weaver pays him a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Garment; Every Mahumetan a <hi>Drim,</hi> or Patach, which amounts to a Thouſand <hi>Imperials</hi> every Year.</p>
                  <p>Moſt certainly the Revenues of this Empire ſeem to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, if we conſider the Extent of ſo many Large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. But on the other ſide we are to obſerve, That the Prices of all things are very low. A huge Oxe may be bought for half a Dollar. The Souldiers live upon Fleſh and Fiſh without bread; and Servants Wages are paid in neceſſary Commodities not in money.</p>
                  <p>Again, if we conſider the plenty of all things; the <hi>Abiſsine</hi> Emperour has enough and to ſpare: not that his Diadem gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with Gemms or Pearls, or that his Treaſuries are full of Money; or that his Cupboards ſhine with Silver and Gold Plate; or that his Table is ſpread with Forraign Banquets while his Subjects are in want, -his Courtiers poor, and his Souldiers under penury. But he has that which ſuffices to afford him moderate Dyet, and ſlender Cloathing. Then for his Souldiers and his Warlike Subjects, that is to ſay, his poor People, they, detain'd at home by no delicacies, are ready ſtill to gird on their Swords. Which they who dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and courageouſly know how to weild in a good Cauſe, need never want Gold nor Silver, nor what ever Mortals eſteem pretious and deſireable.</p>

Some of the Pillars are ſtill to be ſeen, with Inſcriptions of unknown Letters, remaining ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of their Antiquity, now demoliſh'd by the Wars, or defac'd with Age. The City it ſelf, now totally ruin'd, looks more like a Village, than a Town of Note; <hi>ſo fading and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant are thoſe things which men account moſt durable.</hi> How many Cities, how many Monuments now lye in aſhes, whoſe Founders are well known? and how many are yet in being, whoſe Founders are unknown? As for this, it began to fall to decay by degrees, preſently after that the Kings of <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinia</hi> relinquiſh'd it, and remov'd their Court from thence, as being depriv'd of thoſe advantages that attend the abodes of Princes. Thus the Seat of the Empire being Tranſlated to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> the <hi>Weſt</hi> was neglected. And the ſame Fate, no doubt, had certainly befallen <hi>Rome,</hi> had it not bin ſuſtain'd by the Care of the Biſhops, now the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontiffs. In the time of the <hi>Adelan</hi> Warr, the Revolt of the Vice-Roy of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi> in the Raign of King <hi>Menas;</hi> and laſtly, when the <hi>Turks</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:59633:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
invaded that Country, it was totally lay'd waſt; and now can ſcarcely ſhelter a hundred Inhabitants: onely the Ruines ſtill remain, to teſtifie that once it was great and populous. It is Seated in the Fourteenth degree and a half of Northern Latitude, Encircled with pleaſant and fertile Fields which afford a Proſpect becoming a Royal Manſion. It lies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Red-Sea Five and forty <hi>Portugal</hi> Leagues, or ſix or Seaven tireſom days Journey by reaſon of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that lye between. The antient things of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> were wont to be here inaugurated; nor would <hi>Suſneus</hi> admit of his Coronation in any other place, though when he related the particulars of the Ceremonies to the Commander of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> he could not but laugh at them, as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous himſelf, <hi>For many things are to be done by Princes to pleaſe the Vulgar, which to others may ſeem ſuperfluous,</hi> Such as were for the moſt part the <hi>Solemn Ceremonies of the Antients inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by mean Capacities, but retain'd by the more prudent. Tellezius</hi> thus ſets them down. When <hi>Suſneus</hi> was to be Crown'd, firſt the Maſters of the Ceremonies, read to the King out of their Memorandums, how and in what order every thing was to be perform'd. The Army being drawn up, the Foot march'd firſt: then follow'd the Horſe with their Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings: after them the Courtiers Comb'd, and neatly habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: preſently appear'd the Emperour himſelf upon a ſtately Prauncer, clad with a cloſe Purple Damaſcene Tunic, and over that a magnificent <hi>Attalic</hi> Veſtment, with narrow Sleeves hanging down to the ground. When they came to a great Stone engraven with Forraign Characters, not far from the Church of <hi>Axuma,</hi> near to which the Solemnities of the Inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration us'd to be perform'd, the Emperour with all the Courtiers alighting from their Horſes, ſtood upon the Ground that was ſpread with rich Carpets. At what time the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of <hi>Axuma,</hi> holding a Silken Cord croſs the Street ſtopp'd the Way, and as the King preſs'd to go forwards, they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him, and ask'd him, <hi>Who he was?</hi> who anſwering, <hi>I am the King of the Iſraelites.</hi> They reply'd, <hi>Surely thou art not our King.</hi> Which ſaid, he retir'd ſmiling. At length being ask'd a third time; he reply'd, <hi>I am the King of Sion:</hi> and drawing forth his Cimitar, cut the Cord: which done, the Virgin cry'd out, <hi>Of a certainty, thou art our King of Sion.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently all the Guns they have are fir'd, and the neighbouring Mountains rang with loud Acclamations; the Drums beat
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59633:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the noiſe of the Flutes, and the Trumpets fill'd the Air with harmonious Levets. Which done, the <hi>Metropolitan Simeon</hi> accompany'd with all the Eccleſiaſtical Orders of Clerks, Monks, and Canons, ſinging ſeveral Songs and Hymns, conducted the King to the firſt Porch of the Church, and there ſet the Diadem upon his Head. The King being crown'd, if it may be ſo call'd; proceeded forward into the Temple, and there receiv'd the Euchariſt; which having done he rode back to the Camp with his Diadem upon his head. For in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> they uſe no Scepter. Nor is the Crown any other than a Hatt twice doubled, with an Azure colour'd Silken broad brimm trimm'd with Gold and Silver Plates, in the likeneſs Lillies; with a row of falſe ſtones gliſtering between every Plate.</p>
                  <p>Beſides <hi>Axuma,</hi> there are no Cities in <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> and but few Towns. In the Kingdom of <hi>Tigra, Dobarva</hi> is the Seat of the Vice-Roys: <hi>Fremona,</hi> the firſt Reſidence of the Fathers of the Society, enlarg'd by the <hi>Portugueſes. Gubay,</hi> a Town in <hi>Dembea,</hi> where the Queen reſides. <hi>Nanina</hi> in <hi>Gojam,</hi> long inhabited by the <hi>Portugueſes. Macana celace,</hi> in <hi>Amhara.</hi> To reck'n up more is not worth the while: neither is it certain whether thoſe already mention'd are ſtanding or no. For in regard of the meanneſs of the Building, there is nothing of invitation to hinder their being deſerted and layd waſt by the Inhabitants themſelves; in regard the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to live after the manner of Villagers, not caring that their Houſes ſhould joyn one to another; which ſaves them many Suits in Law. For they never fear any Actions about Party-Walls, ſtopping up of Lights, or Nuſances of Water-Courſes. In places that are fertile and till'd, you ſhall ſee the Fields, as it were, planted with Houſes, which affords no unpleaſant Proſpect. They have neither Caſtles nor Forts. The Celebrated Mountains of <hi>Amhara</hi> are their onely Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, where the Kings Children were formerly committed to Cuſtody. The <hi>Habeſsines</hi> wonder to hear of ſo many great Cities among Us. For they do not believe the Country can afford Timber and Food ſufficient for ſo many Houſes, nor the Cattel that muſt ſupport ſuch Numbers of People, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long in one place. For they pitch their Tents up and down the Country, and cut down and make havock of what ever they have need of, without any conſideration of the dammage, or regard to the future. For they neither Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59633:94"/>
their own Rivers, neither do they know what belongs to Carriage or Stores; living without any care of to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Kings Court, his Titles, and his Court-Officers.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The Kings live in Tents: <hi>P. Pays</hi> built a Palace. The Kings Table. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attend: Plain dyet. The King and the Nobility cramm'd. They drink after they have done: They read the whole Pſalter before meales. The ancient manner of receiving Ambaſſadors: now chang'd. Formerly two Court Officers: diſcontinnu'd. The <hi>Ras</hi> now chief Miniſter in Peace and War. Officers beſide.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter the Kings of <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> left <hi>Axuma,</hi> they never had any conſtant Manſion, nor any Palaces, but contented themſelves to live in Tents. But at length <hi>Peter Pays</hi> built the King a Palace after the <hi>European</hi> manner, which coſt him an incredible deal of Labour and Induſtry; for that in regard of the want of Artiſts, he was forc'd to teach them every thing, and to look after the Work like a Maſter-Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He choſe to build this Houſe in a moſt commodious and delightful place call'd <hi>Gorgora,</hi> being a kind of Peninſula, almoſt ſurrounded by the <hi>Tzanic</hi> Lake, where the King was wont to take up his Winter-Quarters, and contriv'd it very ſpacious and beautiful, with Rooms of State, Bed-Chambers, Galleries, Battlements and Balconies, which yielded a moſt pleaſant Proſpect over the Lake, and the Neighbouring Fields. Inſomuch, that it was not inferiour to the Country Palaces of ſome of our <hi>Europeans</hi> Princes. The <hi>Abeſsines</hi> were amaz'd when they ſaw one ſtory rais'd above another, which they thought could never have bin done: and call'd it <hi>Houſe upon Houſe.</hi> Nor till that time did they believe the Fathers, when they told them of the numerous and ſplendid Palaces, Sumptuous Cathedrals, and Stately Monaſteries in <hi>Europe.</hi> For thoſe things they related to the <hi>Abeſsines,</hi> to make them in love with the Magnificence and Majeſty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>The Garniture of the Kings Table is much different from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59633:94"/>
ours. For no perſon is admitted into the Room while the King is at Dinner; or if any of the Nobility be invited, they muſt ſtay till the King riſes: then they take their places at the ſame Table, and eat the Kings Leavings, which is look'd upon as a very great Honour. Yet the Fathers of the Society were admitted to Dine by themſelves, in the ſame Room next to <hi>Suſneus</hi>'s Bed-Chamber. To which purpoſe there were two low little round Tables, about Eighteen Spans in Compaſs, brought in to the Room and plac'd upon the Ground which was ſpread with Carpets; one leſſer for the King, another bigger for the Fathers, but without Table-Cloaths or Napkins: inſtead of which they made uſe of thin Wafers made of Wheat or Rie paſt. So that their Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths ſerv'd them for Bread, which there was no need for the Servants to take away, fold up, or waſh: no Trenchers, Knives, Forks, nor Spoons: no Salt-ſeller, no Pepper or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-box; nothing of Extravagant was there to be ſeen: A great Eaſe to them in time of Warr; to us an impediment, while ſo many Carts, ſo many Waggons are requir'd to carry Kitchin Utenſils, and Kitchin Officers, to pleaſure our Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Meat is ſerv'd up by Women, not in Gold or Silver Diſhes, but in broad Earthen Platters, which would never tempt an <hi>European</hi> Thief. They are made of black Clay, with covers of Straw neatly woven and painted. The meat is very ordinary, Fleſh and Broths of ſeveral ſorts boyl'd after their faſhion. So ſoon as the Diſhes are marſhall'd; the Hangings are preſently let down, leſt any one ſhould ſee the King while he is eating: and truly there is good Reaſon why. For, the King and the chief Nobility, a thing you would think almoſt incredible, account it a great trouble to lift their hands to their mouths. And therefore the Children belonging to Court, take the meat and put it in their mouths, and if the Gobbets be too bigg, they thruſt 'em in, as they do that cramm Capons. The crumms that fall, ſometimes they put again i' their chopps after they are well ſoak'd in the Broth. A way of eating that may well deſerve a good thick covering: as being a ſight, that would certainly cauſe our ſqueamiſh Stomachs, that will hardly eat off of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Trenchers, to riſe a hungry. But this is common both to Lord and Peaſant, that they never drink till they have done feeding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:59633:95"/>One thing we muſt not omit, which is, that they always read Prayers both before and after meals: a thing that ſome of our Courtiers are in a manner aſham'd of, who will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tarry to hear a ſhort Grace; while here you ſhall have the whole <hi>Pſalter</hi> repeated at their great Feaſts, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the Gueſts: For he whoſe Office it is, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to every one a part. The King and they that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to it, know their proper time. The larger <hi>Pſalmes</hi> are divided among more, the ſhorter to one ſingly. And thus by ſeveral, the whole <hi>Pſalter</hi> is read, as it were, in a moment. For the <hi>Pſalter</hi> is made uſe of by all: neither have they any other Book for dayly Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Their manner of giving Audience to Ambaſſadors is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what it was in former times. For <hi>Alvarez</hi> relates how that after long waiting, and a deal of haughty formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſadour, <hi>Lodowic Limaeus,</hi> was four times ask'd <hi>From whence he came?</hi> and that he receiv'd no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the firſt day, but that <hi>They were Welcome:</hi> nor were they admitted to the King; and yet Preſents were to be left. Nor was the Embaſſadour to be Viſited by any one, before he had kiſs'd the Kings hands. At length, after he had bin ſeveral times call'd, he was firſt admitted to diſcourſe the King, the Hangings being let down between them; and at laſt, with much ado, to ſee and ſalute the King. Of which the chief Reaſon was thought to be, becauſe he had brought no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (for it is not lawful to appear before the Eaſtern or <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Kings, without an acknowledgment) or elſe becauſe he wanted the Kings Credentials. Which ſuperbneſs is now a days layd aſide; for that being humbled by ſo many Loſſes and Calamities, they begin to reckon Urbanity and Civility among the reſt of the Vertues.</p>
                  <p>Among the Court Employments, the chiefeſt Dignity was that of the Perſon who was call'd <hi>Bahtudet,</hi> of whom one was of the <hi>Right</hi> hand, and the other of the <hi>Left.</hi> They were the chief Miniſters of State, and manag'd all Affairs, and were entruſted with all the Kings Secrets; with them alone the King conſulted; few others being admitted into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: as if Majeſty were more Venerable when conceal'd. But afterwards ſo much Greatneſs in Subjects began to grow
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59633:95"/>
irkſome to the Kings; and ſome there are alſo that abuſe their Power: few men being able to contain themſelves within thoſe Bounds of moderation, to be able to do all things, and yet not to covet all things. For there are many Examples of thoſe, who out of a deſire of preſerving their Greatneſs, have requited their Maſters with ill Turns for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the higheſt nature; making uſe of that authority which they receiv'd from their Princes, to their miſchief. By which means <hi>Kings</hi> have bin overwhelm'd by the hatred of the People; or elſe have bin forc'd to pull down that Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with extream hazard, which they themſelves advanc'd. Thoſe Princes act more prudent that keep the Power in their own hands, never truſting to the Management of one ſingle Perſon. Neither are they leſs provident Miniſters, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver affect it: For the Grand Affairs of a Kingdom are more ſafely and eaſily manag'd by Plurality.</p>
                  <p>To theſe ſucceeded another Chief Officer whom the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians</hi> call <hi>Ras,</hi> from the Arabic word which ſignifies a <hi>Head.</hi> The reaſon of whoſe inſtitution at firſt, was for the Command of the Army. But as Warlike Command, and Martial Fame excell all other accompliſhments; it came to paſs in a ſhort time, that theſe chief Generals advanc'd themſelves above all others, to govern the Kings Counſels, and ſo by degrees to be the chief Miniſters of State for the management of all Affairs, both Forraign and Domeſtic, ſuch a one was <hi>Ras-Athanaſius,</hi> who firſt depoſed <hi>Zadenghel,</hi> and then <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo that <hi>Suſneus</hi> did not hold it convenient to confer ſo great a dignity upon any perſon, unleſs it were by his Brother by the Mothers ſide, by name <hi>Ras-Selach.</hi> Next to him, there are two Comptrollers of the Court. The upper Comptroller, who is called <hi>Bellatenot-Gueta,</hi> as much as to ſay Maſter of the Officers, whoſe juriſdiction reaches all Inferior Vice-Roys, Prefects, Governors of Provinces, and Judges. The other is called <hi>Dakaka Bellatenot-Gueta</hi> who comtroles the Houſhold Servants, the Grooms and ſuch like, who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of mean Condition, and of ſeveral Nations. Slaves alſo ſet free are admitted to Dignities and Offices. For the Kings believe their Slaves, when freed, will be moſt faithful, as owing to their Fortunes to none alive beſides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59633:96"/>Next in Dignity to the Court Officers, are the Vice-Roys, and Princes, Camp-Maſters, Senators, and Kings-Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who are called the leſſer Judges and Magiſtrates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtinction of Superior or Inferior Judges: for they have equal Juriſdiction and Cognizance of all Crimes. The Captain of the Kings Guard they call the <hi>Guardian of the Fire,</hi> not without reaſon comparing the King to Fire. <hi>For that they who are Servants to Kings and Princes, receive heat and warmth from them as from the Fire; though if they act not prudently, they may chance to be cruelly burnt.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the King's Camp.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The Kings Tent deſcribed: The Camp pitch'd in great order. The ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. It conſiſts of four parts: formerly in <hi>Shewa,</hi> now in <hi>Dembea.</hi> How large. As it were a Marching City; the great Power of the Camp-Maſters.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHatever others have feign'd concerning any other Royal City or Metropolis, beſides <hi>Axumas,</hi> are meer Fables. For the Kings of <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> live continually in Tents, whether it be that they are not accuſtomed to Houſes, or that their frequent Wars and tedious marches will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of long reſt. The Kings Pavilion is a very large one, of white colour placed in the middle of the Camp; there being a large ſpace of Ground left void round about it; as well to prevent the Caſualties of Fire, as alſo to receive the Horſes of the Nobility and thoſe that bring Proviſions. Next to him, the Grandees, the Friends and kindred of the <hi>King</hi> and the reſt of the Courtiers pitch up their Apartments. The whole Camp conſiſts of four parts, every one of which has his Camp-Maſter. The firſt part is call'd the <hi>Front;</hi> and the Camp-Maſter is call'd <hi>Fit-aurari.</hi> The Hindmoſt part is call'd <hi>Chuala.</hi> The Firſt Camp-Maſter goes before to take up convenient Ground where there is ſtore of Wood and Graſs, chiefly near ſome River or Lake, to prevent want of Water. Having choſen out his Ground; he fixes a Pole in the Earth with the Royal Banner at the Topp; upon the ſight whereof, they that meaſure for the Nobility, ſet up
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59633:96"/>
their Maſters Lodgings. After them the Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, and others that follow the Camp either for Victuals, or elſe upon buſineſs. And thus in a few hours time the whole Camp appears in the ſame Order as it was before. For every one knowes his place and his proportion, there being never any alteration of the Order, but the ſame Streets and Lanes, the ſame diſtance of Tents, ſo that were it not for the variation of the Proſpect, other Mountains, other Rivers, and another Face of the Country, you would think your ſelf ſtill in the ſame place. When the Cryer has once proclaim'd the day of Removal, they preſently know how to pack up their Baggage, and in what order to march without any more ado; who are to march in the Front, who in the Rear; who on the Right, who on the Left hand: ſo that all things are done without Noiſe or Tumult.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there any thing which more commends the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the <hi>Abeſsines.</hi> For what they have acquir'd by long uſe and continual War, they ſtill retain; never peſter'd with confuſion either marching or ſitting ſtill. The conſtant diſpoſal and largeneſs of the Camp may be underſtood from hence, that the ſame Dialect and the ſame words continue in the ſame Streets and Quarters: in other Quarters another ſort of words, and a different Dialect: as for <hi>Dala,</hi> a word uſed in the Front of the Camp, which ſignifies to <hi>put in;</hi> the Vulgar in the Rear Quarter ſay, <hi>Tshammara.</hi> Of old, before the <hi>Gallans</hi> conquer'd it, the Camp was pitch'd in <hi>Shewa,</hi> a fertile and moſt plentiful Countrey. But for the moſt part in <hi>December,</hi> and that for three or four years together in one place. In the beginning of <hi>Suſneus</hi>'s Reign in the year 1607, they pitch'd at <hi>Coga.</hi> Thence they remov'd to <hi>Gorgora,</hi> in the year 1612, from thence to <hi>Dancaza;</hi> and laſtly to <hi>Guen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> which place, <hi>Bernier</hi> becauſe he had heard perhaps that it was the Reſidence of the King, calls the Metropolis of <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> of which perhaps in a few years there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Camps take up a vaſt deal of room, as well in the Summer as in the Winter, for they do not onely contain the Souldiers, but their Wives and their Children, whoſe work it is to bake their Bread, and make their Hydromel. So that the weak and helpleſs multitude far exceeds the number of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59633:97"/>
the Souldiery. Nor are they without Merchants and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all ſorts, beſides Slaves and Lackeys, neceſſary for ſuch a Multitude: So that the Camp looks more like an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory City, and moving Houſes, then a Martial Camp. So many Tents and Pavilions ſeeming a far off to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Proſpect of ſome great Town. But leſs wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is that which is reported out of <hi>India;</hi> That near the Iſland of <hi>Sumatra,</hi> there are certain Cities, if they may be ſo call'd, which are always ſwimming, and yet great Markets and Fairs are kept therein; and many People live there who have no other Country or Habitation.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Camp maſters whom the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> call <hi>Sebea Catine,</hi> they carry a great ſway in managing the Succeſſion of the Kings, and affairs of greateſt moment. The Kings alſo themſelves are guided by them in making and abrogating Laws; and generally they are the firſt ſprings of Faction and Sedition. And as formerly the <hi>Pretorean</hi> Bands gave Laws to Prince and People, ſo among the <hi>Habesſines</hi> the effect of all Conſultations good or bad derive themſelves from the Camp.</p>

                  </head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Continual war. The Winter cauſes a Truce. The <hi>Habeſſines</hi> good Soldiers. Strong and active. They ſerve without pay. They plunder the Countries as they march. The <hi>Gallans</hi> ſecur'd by their Poverty. The <hi>Habeſſines</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Fire-Arms. Few Muskets, and fewer Musketeteers. Their Armies conſiſt moſt of Foot. Light Armour. Drumms us'd by the Horſe. Their Weapons. Bad Diſcipline: becauſe they count it no ſhame to flie. Their Onſets furious. Their Rocks are their Fortreſſes. The King Commands in chief. Theives unpuniſh'd.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> are a Warlike People and continually exercis'd in War, we have already declar'd: neither is there any reſpit but what is caus'd by the Winter, at what time by reaſon of the Inundations of the Rivers, they are forc'd to be quiet. For they have neither Ships nor Boats: neither do they know how to make Bridges to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a paſſage over their violent Streams. Concerning which, <hi>Gregory</hi> wrote to me in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no making War in</hi> Ethiopia <hi>in the Winter time; neither does the Enemy attack us, nor we them; by reaſon of the great falls of Rain and the Inundations of the Rivers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tellezius</hi> alſo further teſtifies, That the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> are good Souldiers. They ride and manage a Horſe well; and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily take Arms; as well in obedience to their Soveraign, as for other cauſes already mention'd. They are ſtrong, They endure hunger and thriſt beyond belief, and with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſuſtenance can brook any unſeaſonable ſort of weather. They ſerve without pay: contented with honour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and ſuch Lands, as the King after the Roman Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom beſtows upon the well deſerving. Therefore they muſt certainly be thought to ſight much more generouſly and faithfully in the defence of their Countrey then Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. They expect no part of the Enemies Booty, nor no redemption, and therefore never ſerve them in the Field. and becauſe they know not the art of protracting a War, therefore they never are ſparing of themſelves to return home rich. However the Poverty of the Souldiers impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59633:98"/>
the Countries through which they march. For in regard it is a difficult thing to carry Proviſions over ſuch ſteep and rugged Mountains, and long wayes, they take by force what is not freely given them; and by that means lay waſt their own Countries no leſs then their Enemies: whereby the poor Countrey people are conſtrain'd to turn Souldiers, and ſo taught to deal by others, as they were dealt with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For which reaſon they neither can vanquiſh nor make any long purſuit after the <hi>Gallans;</hi> who being retir'd with their Droves, the Purſuers find nothing left behind but Lands untill'd, and empty Cottages. So invincible a Fortreſs is Poverty to withſtand the ſtouteſt Enemy. But, as we have ſaid already, Thoſe <hi>Gallans</hi> might eaſily be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, did but the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> know the uſe of Muskets. <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lezius</hi> writes, that they have among them about fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Muſquets, but not above four Muſqueteers, and they but very bad Fire-men neither; neither do the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders know how to place and order them to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: and therefore after they have once diſcharg'd, the Enemy ruſhes on ſo furiouſly before they can charge again, that they they are forc'd to to throw their Muſquets away: and then another thing is; they have but very little Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>The biggeſt Army which the King brings now into the Field hardly amounts to Forty thouſand Men, among which he has not above Four or Five thouſand Horſe, the reſt are all Foot. Their horſes are couragious and mettleſome, but they never get upon their backs till they are ready to charge the Enemy: at other times they ride their Mules, and lead their Horſes. They are ſlightly arm'd after the manner of the antient <hi>Velites;</hi> and tho their Stirrups are no bigger then onely to thruſt in their great Toes, leaſt if the Horſe ſhould fall, their feet ſhould be hung in the Stirup, yet they ſit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt. Their Weapons are Swords and Darts, as alſo Launces and ſhort Javelins, with which they fight at a diſtance; after which they diſpute it hand to hand with their Swords or Launces, and Bucklers. Their War like Muſick for the Horſe are Drums much bigger then ours, and the King's, which are the biggeſt, go by the name of the <hi>Bear</hi> and the <hi>Lyon.</hi> Beſides which, ſeveral Hornes and Fifes march before Him. They for the moſt part, are
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59633:98"/>
arm'd with two Spears, of which they dart away the one at a diſtance, and maintain a cloſe fight with the other, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves with their Bucklers. The Horſe never fight a foot, nor the Foot a horſeback: a practice very neceſſary in ſuch a Country, where many times there is no uſe of Horſe. In brief, the Military Diſcipline of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> is very irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; rather the fault of the Captains that know not how to command them, than of the Souldiers. For they run away without any fear of Infamy or Puniſhment: neither do they know how to rally when they are once diſorder'd; ſo that the firſt array being broken, the reſt are carry'd away like a Torrent: neither do they ſtrengthen their Wings with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves; neither do they ſeparate the Veterans from the Raw Souldiers, diſheartning the Courage of the one, by the unequal mixture of the other. The fury of the firſt Onſet for the moſt part wins the Field: for which reaſon, the <hi>Gallans</hi> ſurpaſſing the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> in heat and violence, have ſo often vanquiſh'd them. They are not eaſily perſwaded to avoid the Combat, believing it ſloathful and daſtardly to tire out an Enemy by delay, and wait for opportunities. Which has bin the Ruin of many of their Kings, that have joyn'd Battel with more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, than Prudent Advice. The Kings themſelves, for the moſt part bred up in the field, command their own Armies themſelves; or elſe they create a <hi>Ras,</hi> to command in their ſtead.</p>
                  <p>One thing more remains behind, That this Country is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much infeſted with Robbers as well as Enemies; who many times robb in Troops like Souldiers, and very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Roads; and this without any ſearching after, or care taken to puniſh them; by reaſon that the King and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours being wholly buſied with continual Wars, have no time to ridd the Nation of theſe Vermin, who being purſu'd, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhelter themſelves among the Rocks and Mountains.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE ſhall forbear to ſet down over-ancient or incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Relations, concerning the Expeditions of the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> in regard it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us, what part of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> thoſe Writers mean; or how far the Empire of the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> of old extended. For thoſe things which Hiſtorians have deliver'd to memory in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> adjoyning upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> are not preſently to be apply'd to the <hi>Ethiopians.</hi> For that the diſtance between <hi>Egypt</hi> and our <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> comprehends Eight or nine degrees, or a hunder'd <hi>German</hi> Miles and more. In which wide ſpace, <hi>Nubia</hi> was ſeated, ſo that there might be Kings of other <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opick</hi> Nations next to that. And therefore till we ſee the Hiſtories themſelves of the <hi>Abiſsines,</hi> we are unwilling to publiſh Incertainties for Certainties. But that the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> did make ſeveral Famous Expeditions into <hi>Arabia,</hi> is a thing not to be queſtion'd; inſomuch, that ſome of them have made a Computation of their Years from thence: and that the Kingdom of the <hi>Homerites</hi> was totally ſubdu'd by <hi>Caleb,</hi> we have already declar'd. To omit then ſeveral other Wars wag'd with their Neighbours, the Stories of which are to us unknown: as for example, that with the <hi>Nubians</hi> in the 25th Year of the former Century, recorded by <hi>Alvarez;</hi> the moſt lamentable and moſt fatal was that War which they enter'd
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59633:99"/>
into with the <hi>Adelans</hi> their Ancient Enemies. True it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that in the beginning of his Raign, <hi>David</hi> vanquiſh'd them in ſeveral Battels. But after the <hi>Turks</hi> had vanquiſh'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſome Ports of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> the <hi>Adelans,</hi> ſtrengthen'd by their aſſiſtance, turn'd the Scale of Fortune, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Victors. For King <hi>Adelis</hi> ſent one <hi>Ahmed,</hi> a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> vulgarly call'd <hi>Grainus,</hi> or <hi>Grannus,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Left-handed,</hi> with an Army to invade <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> and revenge the Loſſes of the <hi>Adelans.</hi> He, about the Year 1526, ſubdu'd all <hi>Fata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara.</hi> For the firſt two Years the War was carry'd on with various Succeſs; but the next Twelve Years to the Year 1540, at what time King <hi>David</hi> deceas'd, the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> had the worſt of it. The King having loſt the choiceſt of his Kingdoms, and his Second Son <hi>Menas,</hi> who was taken Priſoner, languiſh'd out the reſt of his days in the Rock <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> were brought to that low and miſerable Condition, that they began to deſpair of their Countrey. For ſuch are the Lamentations which we find made by thoſe that liv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Epilogue printed after the Goſpel of St. <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not without reaſon do we weep, when we call to mind the Captivity of our Brethren, our Countrey layd waſt, Our Temples Burnt, our Books and our Sanctuaries conſum'd with Fire, and the Profanation of our Monaſteries by that wicked and impious</hi> Grainus, <hi>a Companion for Goats, a Perſcutor and Invader of the Sheep, from</hi> Waigaci, <hi>to the Red Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the Cauſes of ſuch a Torrent of Calamities, theſe may be reck'nd not to be the leaſt: for that the King, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by his own ſluggiſh humour, had given himſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to the Temptations of Pleaſure; ſo dedicated to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that he permitted ſome of them to have their Idols in his Palace. Next, the <hi>Turks,</hi> out of their inbred hatred to Chriſtianity, had ſupply'd their <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Friend with Fire-Arms, and ſuch as knew well how to uſe them; whoſe Thunder, then by the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> firſt heard, they were not able to endure; nor did they know how to cure the Wounds which the Bullets made, as not being accuſtom'd to them: beſides, that on the other ſide, the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſly abounding throughout <hi>Abeſsinia,</hi> favourably every where entertain'd thoſe of their own Sect. Many alſo of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59633:100"/>
the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> themſelves, following, as is uſual, the Fortune of the Victor, forſook their Native Soveraign: So that now every thing threaten'd utter deſtruction and deſolation, when the King, lurking among the Rocks, began to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of craving Succour from the <hi>Portugals.</hi> To that purpoſe in the Year 1535, one <hi>John Bermudes,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> was ſent. Who firſt arriv'd at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 1538, where he was made Patriarch joyntly of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went into <hi>Portugal</hi> in the Year 1539, and there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Commiſſion from <hi>John</hi> the Third, to the Vice-Roy of <hi>India,</hi> to ſend Aſſiſtance to the <hi>Abeſsines.</hi> Their Commander was <hi>Chriſtopher Gomez,</hi> a Perſon of great Valour, who in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1541, enter'd the Kingdom with Six ſmall Field-Pieces, and Four hundred and fifty Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. At firſt they had a very ſevere March: for they wanted Horſes and Teams: the Country being ſo waſted, that they were forc'd to carry their Luggage and Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon their ſhoulders over moſt rugged and ſteep Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Nevertheleſs, theſe Souldiers, few in number, but all choice men, and coveting the honour to reſtore the King of <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> to his Kingdom and his Liberty, patiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went all ſorts of hardſhip. This caus'd a change of Fortune, ſo that now the late Victors were every where put to flight, aſtoniſh'd at the Execution of the Guns. In the firſt place, <hi>Gomez</hi> aſſail'd the Rock <hi>Amba-Sanet,</hi> which was thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, and forc'd the Enemy to quit it. Whereby he won to himſelf great Fame, and highly Encourag'd the <hi>Habeſsines.</hi> Firſt therefore the Kings Mother, confiding in this ſmall Force, left a certain Rock, which gave acceſs to none, nor permitted any to aſcend, but as they were drawn up or let down with Ropes, and chear'd them with her preſence. <hi>Claudius,</hi> who lay ſculking in the Kingdom of <hi>Shewa,</hi> had writ word he would be ſuddainly with them, but durſt not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture through ſo many Numbers of the Enemies that lay in the way. So that <hi>Gomez</hi> with ſome few of the <hi>Habeſsinians,</hi> was conſtrain'd to bear the whole burthen of the War with a moſt incredible Courage. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> were not ignorant of the Gallantry of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> nor did they believe their own People had hearts ſufficient to withſtand the Fury of the great Guns. And therefore thinking it convenient as well to try the Diſpoſition of <hi>Gomez,</hi> as to ſpie what Force he had, they ſent certain Commiſſioners to him, pretending to blame
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59633:100"/>
blame his raſhneſs, and to offer him ſafe Conduct, as being deceiv'd by the <hi>Abeſsines,</hi> if he thought fit to return. But <hi>Gomeus,</hi> as it were provok'd with the indignity they had put upon him, gave them an anſwer that favour'd both of fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and contempt, telling them, <hi>That he was ſent by the moſt Potent King of the</hi> Portugals, <hi>to revenge the Injuries done to the</hi> Habeſſines; <hi>and that his coming was not to return again, but to fight</hi> Grainus. The Enemies Force in that place was 15000 Foot, and 1500 Horſe, together with 200 <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, whom <hi>Gomeus</hi> had moſt reaſon to fear. But he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Courage of his own men, tho but a ſmall parcel, reſolv'd upon a Battel. However, he keeps within his Camp. On the other ſide, <hi>Grainus</hi> would not ſtir, well knowing the <hi>Portugals</hi> had Proviſion but for a few days; which being ſpent, they would be forc'd to forſake the Hill where they lay En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd, and ſo might be eaſily environ'd by his Numbers. Nor did that cunning in part fail the <hi>Barbarian;</hi> for the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> were forc'd to forſake their Camp, but could not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the Enemy, in regard their Field-Pieces and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets ſtruck ſuch a Terror into the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> that they, contemning all Orders of their Captain, would not ſtir. And it ſo happen'd, that <hi>Grainus</hi> himſelf, riding about to force his men on, was wounded in the Hips with a Muſquet Bullet, and had his Horſe ſhot under him. The fall of the Captain quite damp'd the Courage of the Souldiers; ſo that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently retreated, and the <hi>Portugals</hi> keeping the Field, look'd upon themſelves as Victors. Twelve days after the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> renew'd the Fight, for which the <hi>Portugals</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd. While both ſides fought at firſt with equal Succeſs, an Accident happen'd, lamentable in ſight, but yet the cauſe of the Victory. For while the Souldiers went with their lighted Matches to fetch Powder, a Barrel took fire, the noiſe of which ſo terrify'd the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Horſes, that their Riders not being able to rule them, they diſorder'd the Body of the Army; which the <hi>Portugals</hi> obſerving, lay'd all their force upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> who being put to flight, the reſt eaſily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. However, they could not purſue them far, becauſe they had but Eight Horſes. Nevertheleſs the Enemies Camp was taken and plunder'd. This was the work of that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for the Winter coming on, put an end to farther Action. The Winter now declining, the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too difficult for them to undertake, attack'd another
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59633:101"/>
ſteep Rock in <hi>Samen,</hi> call'd the <hi>Jews Rock,</hi> which was kept by the <hi>Adelans,</hi> with a Garriſon of 1500 men. For it was large, and contain'd many Fields, Meadows, Fountains and Streams. The attempt was occaſion'd by a <hi>Jew,</hi> who had bin formerly Governor of the Rock, who hearing of the Courage of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> advis'd the taking of it, in regard there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Horſes in it, which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> principally wanted: and the more to encourage them, he promis'd to ſhew them ſuch by-ways, that they might be able to ſurprize the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; adding withal, That there would be no ſafe Paſſage for <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſo long as the Enemy held that Paſs. <hi>Gomez</hi> underſtanding by the Queen that the <hi>Jew</hi> ſpake truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the Enterprize with proſperous Succeſs: for having ſlain all the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he got a Booty there of Fourſcore brave Horſes, Three hundred Mules, ſeveral Slaves, and other good Plunder beſide. After which he reſtor'd the Rock to the <hi>Jews,</hi> underſtanding they had always bin faithful to the <hi>Habeſsines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while <hi>Grainus</hi> finding there was no good to be done againſt the <hi>Portugals</hi> without Guns and Fire-Arms, ſent for immediate Aſſiſtance from the Neighbouring <hi>Turks,</hi> and petty Baſha's of <hi>Arabia.</hi> So that he obtain'd from the Baſhaw of <hi>Zebid</hi> a freſh Supply of Seven hundred, ſome ſay, Nine hundred Muſqueteers, and Ten Field-Pieces. Some noble <hi>Arabians</hi> alſo that were his Friends came to his aſſiſtance. <hi>Gomez,</hi> either knowing nothing of this, or elſe heighten'd by his two former Victories, never ſtaying for <hi>Claudius,</hi> as he ought to have done; in regard he delayed ſomewhat longer than was expected, nor yet tarrying for ſome of the <hi>Portugals</hi> who brought Horſes along with them: Or whether it were, that he was conſtrain'd to it, as having no place of Retreat, and did not believe that <hi>Grainus</hi> himſelf would appear before the Winter was over, gave the Enemy the opportunity of a Battel. But being over-powr'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Muſquet Bullet in the Thigh. He himſelf, having loſt many of his own Souldiers, and the ſtouteſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, by the help of the Night eſcap'd to a Rock. The wounded and weary were all ſlain, the reſt diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Woods, while the Camp became a Prey to the Enemy. Fourteen only accompanied <hi>Gamez,</hi> the moſt of them wounded; who void of all aſſiſtance, without food or medicaments, refreſh'd themſelves by the Fountains
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59633:101"/>
which afforded but ſmall relief. There they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and carried to <hi>Grainus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting for joy of his Succeſs. He cauſing about a hundred of the heads of the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> to be brought and laid down before him, upbraided <hi>Gomez</hi> for his madneſs in undertaking a War againſt him: and then after he had receiv'd a ſtern anſwer from his Captive, caus'd him to be tormented to death.</p>
                  <p>After that misfortune, the King came up, ſad for the loſs of <hi>Gomez,</hi> whom he deſired moſt earneſtly to have beheld with his Eyes. Nor were they leſs ſad to whoſe aſſiſtance he came, as well for the loſs they had receiv'd, as becauſe he had brought ſo few Forces with him. Therefore they lay ſtill three or four months, till they could raiſe more. They being come, the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who were now reduc'd to a hundred and twenty, and yet zealous to revenge the death of their Captain, were very urgent with the King to fight, giving him great hopes of Victory. For they had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the <hi>Turks</hi> were return'd home, leaving only two hundred behind them: whether by Command of their <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha,</hi> or taking it ill that <hi>Gomez</hi> was not deliver'd to them. The King, though he had not above Eight thouſand Foot, and Five hundred Horſe, reſolv'd to follow the Inclinations of the <hi>Portugals.</hi> And firſt in a ſlight skirmiſh he routed ſome of the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Forces that marched before; Then ſets upon <hi>Grainus</hi> himſelf, who led an Army of 13000 men, and vanquiſh'd him; <hi>Grainus</hi> himſelf, the Terror of <hi>Habeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> for ſo many years, was ſhot with a Musket Bullet by a <hi>Portugueze,</hi> who reveng'd the death of his Captain. All the <hi>Turks</hi> but fourteen were ſlain. The head of <hi>Grainus</hi> was expoſed to the view of the People in ſeveral Provinces and Kingdoms of <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> to the great comfort of the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For upon the ſight of it, the <hi>Abiſsines</hi> recover'd Vigour and Courage; They congratulated their Kings Succeſs; and they who had revolted, return'd to their duty, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſity for the fault committed. The King conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of thoſe times, thought it convenient to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all, to confirm the wavering, to win the hearts of his People by Clemency, to rally his ſcatter'd Forces, and to do all thoſe things which were neceſſary for the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdom. Onely one of the principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59633:102"/>
to whom the King had granted his pardon, the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> put to death as laying to his charge the Murder of <hi>Gomez.</hi> His perfidiouſneſs was thought to have deſerv'd death; and ſo juſtice prevail'd, without any further notice being taken of it. In the mean time, the <hi>Gallans,</hi> till then an obſcure Nation, were neglected, tho they had invaded many Provinces already laid waſt by the <hi>Adelans;</hi> not being look'd upon as ſuch as would have encreas'd ſo much to the future dammage of the Kingdom. There was ſtill a greater fear of the <hi>Adelans,</hi> who having in time repair'd their Loſſes, onely waited an Opportunity to make a New Invaſion. Soon after their Spies returning with intelligence that the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> were grown ſecure, and conſequently careleſs, under <hi>Nurus</hi> their Captain, they again broke into <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Force; overthrew <hi>Claudius</hi> who advanc'd to oppoſe them, and ſlew him. After his Death, <hi>Menas</hi> obtain'd the Crown, hated by the People for his Cruelty. From thence Inteſtine Wars enſuing, the <hi>Turks</hi> being call'd into the Kingdom, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the King in Battel and ſlew him; which gave them an eaſie advantage to make themſelves Maſters of the Port of <hi>Arkiko,</hi> and the Iland of <hi>Matzua.</hi> His Son <hi>Zerza-Denghel,</hi> much more fortunate than his Father, perform'd many brave Atchievements, and beat the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Tigra,</hi> but could not regain <hi>Arkiko,</hi> nor the Iland of <hi>Matzua.</hi> He raign'd Thirty Years continually vex'd with the <hi>Gallans,</hi> or harraſs'd with Inteſtine Broyls. After his Death, Civil Diſſenſions, and deadly Strifes between the Royal Off-ſpring about the Crown, ſo weakn'd the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> tormented at the ſame time with the <hi>Gallans,</hi> that from that time to this day, they could never Maſter that Potent Enemy. As to their Wars about Religion, that aroſe in the time of the Fathers of the Society, we ſhall ſpeak more hereafter.</p>

                  <p>AT what time the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> making ſeveral Voyages into <hi>India,</hi> made War upon ſeveral Nations, their fame reach'd the <hi>Abeſsinians</hi> alſo; who glad that the Power of the <hi>Saracens</hi> was brought low, and that <hi>Egypt</hi> and their Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was reſtor'd to freedom, were in hopes that the Paſſage to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would be open. At the ſame time alſo was <hi>Peter Covillian</hi> among the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> who had given them more certain Relations concerning the <hi>Portugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Therefore <hi>Helena,</hi> the Grandmother of <hi>David,</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs of the Kingdom, as we have ſaid, ſent an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor into <hi>Portugal,</hi> one <hi>Matthew</hi> an <hi>Armenian,</hi> skilful in Foraign Affairs, and one that underſtood the Arabic Language, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him a Young Nobleman of <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> She was willing to employ a Forraigner, either becauſe ſhe could find none among her own People that were fit for ſuch an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; or that ſhe believ'd none of that Nation could get ſafely into <hi>Portugal,</hi> that Kingdom being hated by the Neighbouring Nations, by reaſon of the Pyracies of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens. Mattheus</hi> was certainly in danger, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Priſoner among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> out of whoſe hands he us'd many devices to eſcape; and at length got ſafe to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Albuquerquez,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>India,</hi> together with his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league. By whom, tho he were nobly there entertain'd, yet he queſtion'd the ſending him into <hi>Portugal:</hi> Becauſe ſuch
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59633:103"/>
an Embaſſie ſeem'd no way Correſpondent to the Dignity and Grandeur of the famous <hi>Presbyter John.</hi> And therefore he reſolv'd firſt to expect the Kings Pleaſure. Thereupon <hi>Matthew</hi> being detain'd Three Years in <hi>India,</hi> at length in the Year 1513. he arriv'd in <hi>Portugal.</hi> The<note n="(z)" place="bottom">They are to be found after the Preface of <hi>Alvarez</hi>'s Itinerary, as alſo in the Treatiſe of <hi>Damianus</hi> a <hi>Goez,</hi> concerning the Great Emperour of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to <hi>Emanuel,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> firſt printed at <hi>Dordrecht.</hi> But <hi>Tellezius</hi> forgot himſelf, when he writes, That <hi>Matthew</hi> brought <hi>David</hi>'s Epiſtle full of Titles: for that is to be attributed to <hi>Alvarez</hi> or <hi>Tragazaabus.</hi>
                     </note> Letters which he brought from <hi>Helena,</hi> being written with the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without any bombaſt of gaudy Titles, ſeem'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more than they that ſent them were able to perform. For they freely offer'd ſafe Conduct, and a Thouſand other neceſſary Conveniences for Ships, which was look'd upon as a piece of boaſting Vanity by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who perhaps thought the Queen had ſpoken of the <hi>Indian</hi> Veſſels of thoſe Nations that lay upon the <hi>Red Sea.

who carry'd them to <hi>Bononia,</hi> and made a long Diſcourſe of the Reſpect and Reverence which the Kings of <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> had to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> They were read before <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, and the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, with the general Applauſe of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> but with no Succeſs. For that <hi>Claudius</hi> the King plainly deny'd to ratifie either thoſe things, or what <hi>John Bermudes</hi> afterwards related at <hi>Rome</hi> to the ſame effect; as if never given in Command, nor ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but that the buſineſs of the Embaſſie, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Letters themſelves had bin faign'd and contriv'd by the <hi>Portugals.</hi> However, the <hi>Habeſsinians</hi> being reduc'd to very great ſtreights, at the Interceſſion of <hi>Bermudes,</hi> had an aſſiſtance of Four hunder'd and fifty men granted, and ſent into <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> by the Command of <hi>John</hi> the Third. But <hi>Peter Pays</hi> poſitively writes, That this was done at the requeſt of the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> And that <hi>Stephen Gomez</hi> who ſail'd into the <hi>Red Sea</hi> to burn the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ships, and by chance came to an Anchor before the Iland of <hi>Matzua,</hi> after he had conſulted his Councel of Warr, reſolv'd to ſend the ſaid Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, as ſeeming to be for the honour of God and the King. Of which Conſultation there had certainly bin no need, if the King had Commanded the Supply before. However it were, that Succour was not onely very neceſſary, but very advantageous to the <hi>Habesſines.</hi> From which time the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſsines</hi> were not onely gratefully, but honourably receiv'd among the <hi>Habeſsines:</hi> nor did they then refuſe the <hi>Latin</hi> Religion, but frequently went to the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Chappels, and admitted Them into Theirs. Moreover, they alſo gave Liberty to the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Women that were marry'd to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> to go to Maſs with their Husbands, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the ſame Ceremonies with them. So that during the Raign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> there was great Hopes both at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> that the <hi>Habeſsinians</hi> might be perſwaded to embrace the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion. But that Hope proving vain, there was for ſome time a Ceſſation of Embaſſies, and the <hi>Abeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Friendſhip with the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> was almoſt interrupted; untill by the Artifices of the Fathers of the Society, the Minds of the later Kings were ſomewhat more inclinably diſpos'd to give Obedience to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <hi>Fecur-Egzie</hi> was choſen, and with him <hi>Antonie Fernandez</hi> was joyn'd; who were commanded by unknown and by-ways to Travel <hi>Southward,</hi> till they reach'd <hi>Melinda,</hi> upon the Shore of the <hi>Indian Ocean,</hi> from whence the Paſſage was more Eaſie and Safe into <hi>India.</hi> Thereupon ſetting forth out of <hi>Gojam,</hi> they Travell'd through <hi>Enarea,</hi> from thence into the Kingdom of <hi>Zendero,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Cambata,</hi> the Laſt Kingdom under the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Dominions. Thence Travelling into <hi>Alaba,</hi> they were forbid to go any farther, by the Governour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, who was a <hi>Mahumetan.</hi> He apprehended the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador with his Train; and had not the Law of Nations bin of ſome force among the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (for they had about them to ſhew both their Letters and Preſents from the Emperour) they had bin put to death, with the Law in their own hands. Being by that means ſet at Liberty, after a Years and ſeven Months time ſpent in hard Travel, after many ſad Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Savage Barbarity and a Thouſand Jeopardies, they return'd home without effecting any thing. Nor can any reaſon be certainly given, why thoſe unknown and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ways were choſen, thorough ſo many Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo many Wild and Deſert Countries, when the Road lay ſo plain through the Kingdom of <hi>Denoale</hi> in Friendſhip with the <hi>Abiſsines,</hi> to the Port of <hi>Baylur,</hi> which the Patriarch of <hi>Portugal</hi> afterwards ſecurely made uſe of: as if ſo tedious a Journey had bin impos'd upon the Undertakers, not ſo much to go upon an Embaſſie, as for the Diſcovery of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Countries, and By-Roads, for the Direction of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
                  <p>After that, there happening a difference between them and the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> all manner of Commerce and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the <hi>Europeans</hi> ceas'd: Inſomuch, that now they would with great reluctancy admit thoſe whom before they ſo highly admir'd, and with great difficulty would diſmiſs, out of their affection to Arts and Sciences; eſpecially, if they ſuſpected them to be Clergy-men, or under Religious Vows.

For which reaſon they try'd them firſt, by offering a Wife to every Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, they rarely ſend any Embaſſadors abroad, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they have need of the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. For they are not onely ignorant of forraign Affairs and Languages, but of the Ways and Roads of other Countries. By reaſon of their Vicinity to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and thence their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Commerce one with another, ſometimes they are forc'd to ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as in the Year 1660. So in the Year 1661, one <hi>Michael</hi> was ſent thither with the wonted Preſents; a living <hi>Tecora;</hi> ſeveral Skins of dead ones; Pigmies and the like, as <hi>Thevenot</hi> writes. In the Year 1671, another Embaſſador was ſent, with ſome of thoſe painted Beaſts, and Letters to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Governour of <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi> But they who are ſent, are generally Forrainers, <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Armenians,</hi> or elſe <hi>Arabians.</hi> But as for what <hi>Leonardus Rauchwolf</hi> writes in his Itinerary, it is altogether vain and falſe: That <hi>Presbyter John</hi> having made a League with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſent a <hi>Perſian</hi> Biſhop with ſo many Prieſts, that in Two years time they converted Twenty Chriſtian Cities to the Chriſtian Religion. It ſeems to be an old and confus'd Relation, and to be underſtood of that ſame ancient <hi>Aſiatic Preſter Chan,</hi> Neighbouring at that time upon the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But he aſcribes this paſſage to the Emperour of the <hi>Abeſsines,</hi> and that it came to paſs Twelve years before his coming. <hi>Philip Nicolai</hi> believ'd him, and inſerted this Figment into his Book concerning the Raign of Chriſt, adding the Year 1562, at what time the Affairs of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> were in their moſt afflicted Eſtate.</p>

So that when they beſtow any Government upon them, they uſe this form, <hi>We have created our Servant ſuch a one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of this, or that Province.</hi> Nor do they ever diſcourſe them but in the ſingular number, <hi>Thou:</hi> whereas we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally make uſe in our Language of the ſecond perſon plural. No other Epithite do they afford their own Queens, tho of the higheſt Rank of Nobility. <hi>We have caus'd to Raign,</hi> that is, <hi>We have taken to Wife our Servant ſuch a one.</hi> Nor do they diſdain theſe Titles: but on the contrary call themſelves reciprocally <hi>his Servants.</hi> This word <hi>Servant,</hi> was very ill digeſted by a generous <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> as looking upon the title of <hi>Slave,</hi> to be a diſgrace to him that was a <hi>Freeman.</hi> And therefore he offer'd a good Summ of Money to him, that, according to Cuſtome, was to proclaim the Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him, to leave out the word <hi>Servant,</hi> and onely to proclaim his bare name; but could not obtain it. Nor is the <hi>Negus</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to be tax'd for this alone, ſeeing all the Princes of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> uſe the ſame Cuſtom. The ſame So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty is claim'd and maintain'd by the <hi>Ruſsian</hi> Emperour; whoſe Grandees never call themſelves any other then <hi>Golop,</hi> his <hi>Servants;</hi> nor in their Letters which they write to him do they ſubſcribe their names any otherwiſe than in the<note n="(h)" place="bottom">As for Example; <hi>Hanſellus, Stephanuel, Laurentioll,</hi> thy Servant. <hi>Olear.</hi> his Itinerary.</note>

And ſurely it is the chief Office of Kings to hear the Complaints of their Suppliants, and to adminiſter timely Juſtice to their Subjects.

                     <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of their Judiciary Proceedings and Puniſhments.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Their Judicial Proceedings very plain. Witneſſes ſlightly and curſorily exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd. Appeals rare. Their Puniſhments, Stoning, Drubbing, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Homicides how puniſhed. A Diſcourſe of Like for Like.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe manner of their Judicial Proceedings is very plain and ordinary. For all Controverſies are determin'd by word of Mouth, without any noiſe of Proceſs, without any Writs, or Writings, of which the moſt part of the Nation is ignorant. The Plaintiff has liberty to produce his Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which the Defendant may refuſe, if he have any reaſon to ſuſpect them But in regard of their ignorance of the true Proceedings by way of Interrogatory and proof, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how to examin a Witneſs, it muſt of neceſſity follow, That Juſtice is but ill adminiſter'd, where the Witneſſes are ſo curſorily heard. It is lawful to appeal from Inferiour Sentences either to the King or the Court-Tribunals: but that is ſeldom done; by reaſon of the Poverty of the People, and the tediouſneſs of Travelling: and partly out of the Little hopes they have of redreſs. For the Governours and Judges of Provinces are offended with appeals, as ſeeming to them an accuſation of Injuſtice; and therefore the wrong'd Parties fearing their diſpleaſure, rather chooſe to loſe their right, than the favour of the Judges. Neither does the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning of Office afford any relief againſt an unjuſt Sentence. For either through Favour or for Money they obtain a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for all things done amiſs in their Magiſtracy.</p>
                  <p>Among the ſorts of Puniſhments inflicted upon Offenders, beſides <hi>Beheading</hi> and <hi>Hanging,</hi> the moſt ready at hand is <hi>Stoning</hi> to death: the Soyl affording ſufficient materials for that ſort of Execution. The next is <hi>Drubbing,</hi> if the Crime be not Capital.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:59633:108"/>The puniſhment of the Nobility, is Exilement into the <hi>Zanic</hi> Lake, or into their high and ſteep Rocks, which are in a manner like Ilands; from whence however they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcape by reaſon that the People are eaſily corrupted by Bribery.</p>

                  <p>Moſt certainly the Law of <hi>Like for Like,</hi> was always and ſtill is accompted the moſt juſt, and plaineſt among ſeveral Nations.

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the <hi>Abiſſines</hi> corrupt: and why. The firſt Relation of <hi>Matthew</hi> the <hi>Armenian</hi> falſe; <hi>Tzagazaabus</hi>'s Confeſſion as little to be credited. Thoſe of the Fathers, and <hi>Tellezius</hi> more certain.

No piece of holy Worſhip among the <hi>Habeſſines.</hi> Females circumcis'd. Why the <hi>Abiſſines</hi> abſtain from Swines Fleſh. The Various Customs of Nations concerning Meats.

They abſtain from the ſhrunck ſinew What to be thought of <hi>Candaces</hi> Eunuch. <hi>Menihelec</hi>'s Posterity revolted from the true Religion. <hi>Claudius</hi> diſclaims the Judaic Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw we proceed to the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the <hi>Habeſsinians,</hi> then which there is not any other more corrupt. For whatever we find ſcatter'd in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, were neither collected out of the Books which are publickly authentic in <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> nor taken from the report of any perſons there skill'd in the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs of that Country, but partly ill related through the Raſhneſs of the Writers themſelves; partly by the ſame perſons or others ill underſtood through their ignorance of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59633:109"/>The firſt Relation concerning the Religion of the <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,</hi> was ſet forth by <hi>Damianus</hi> a <hi>Goez,</hi> a noble <hi>Luſitanian,</hi> from the Report of <hi>Matthew</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> Firſt <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> which Narrative of his<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                        <hi>For thus he ſayes in his Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> Matthew, in regard he was an <hi>Armenian,</hi> could not ſo perſpicuouſly underſtand our affairs, eſpecially thoſe that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our Faith. And therefore he reported many things to King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> which are not in uſe among <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s. Which he did not out of deſire to tell an untruth, becauſe he was a good man, but becauſe he knew little concerning our Religion. <hi>But in my opinion, that good man</hi> Matthew <hi>ſpake many things, which he knew much better.</hi>
                     </note> for his ignorance. Tho he himſelf in the Confeſſion of his Faith, which the ſame<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Extant in the 2. Tom. of <hi>Spain</hi> illuſtrated, p. 1302.</note> 
                     <hi>Goez</hi> ſet forth, did not much excel him either for truth or probability, for which reaſon <hi>Tellezius</hi> not undeſervedly reprehends him. Certainly <hi>Gregory</hi> was very much offended with him; And when he heard his following Doctrines,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of the Father, and the beginning of himſelf: in the ſame manner that the Holy Ghoſt, was the Spirit of himſelf, and proceeded from the Father and the Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That he deſcended into Hell where was the Soul of</hi> Adam, <hi>and Chriſt himſelf, which Soul of</hi> Adam <hi>Chriſt received from the Virgin</hi> Mary: and toward the latter end of the Book, <hi>That Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into Hell for the Soul of</hi> Adam <hi>and not for his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Souls of men piouſly deceas'd are not crucify'd in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory upon the Sabaoth and Lords Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That by the Decree and Commandment of Queen</hi> Maqueda <hi>the Women were alſo to be Circumcis'd, as having a certain glandulous piece of Fleſh, not unfit to receive the Impreſsion and mark of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, when <hi>Tellezius</hi> heard theſe things, and many other of the ſame mixture, in no ſmall heat and Paſſion, he cry'd out, <hi>That they were Fictions, Dreams, nay meer Lyes:</hi> frequently repeating theſe words; <hi>If he ſaid this, he was a Beaſt of the Field.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet out of theſe Books moſt of thoſe Stories have flow'd, which our Writers have made public, concerning the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59633:110"/>
of the <hi>Abeſsines.</hi> But the Fathers of the Society, having bin converſant ſo long in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> and view'd the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Books, after ſeveral Diſputations and Diſcourſes with them, have bin able to afford us more Truth, whoſe Acts and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings being free for the peruſal of <hi>Tellezius,</hi> we ſhall cull the choiceſt of his accurate Relations, and what he has reported more ambiguous or more partially, out of his diſlike of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion, we ſhall correct out of their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or from the Diſcourſes of <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Certainly to Chriſtians, no Hiſtory can be more pleaſant than that of Eccleſiaſtical affairs; eſpecially if we look back to the Primitive Church. For whom would it not raviſh into a high admiration of the wonderful Providence of God as well in founding as preſerving his Church? when he ſhall conſider that it grew up, and increas'd, not by the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arms or human Arts, but by the Oppreſſion of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh perſecution. To whom can it be unpleaſing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with a Pious Contemplation, the undaunted Courage of the Martyrs, the Conſtancy of her Doctors, the Sincerity of the Chriſtian People, the Purity of the Faith, the Strife of Good Works, the Patience of the Weak, the plainneſs of the Rites and Ceremonies? Which when they once began to be alter'd, with the reverence to the Church be it ſpoken, then alſo enter'd in Pride inſtead of Modeſty, Ambition inſtead of Charity, together with Faction and Contention. As if our leiſure and our Quiet were therefore granted us by Heaven to conſume that time in making Scrutinies into all the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith, and moving ſuch impertinent Queſtions, which ought to be ſpent in exerciſes of Charity and Piety.</p>
                  <p>But I return to the Religion of the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> concerning the Original of which, there are various Opinions of ſundry Authors. They that admit the Tradition of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> concerning Queen <hi>Maqueda,</hi> are of Opinion, that the <hi>Abeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines</hi> had the true knowledge of God, ever ſince the Raign of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> and that their Judaic Rites, ſuch as <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, abstaining from meats forbidden, Obſervation of the Sabboth, Marriage of the Brothers Wife, and the like,</hi> had their Original from thence. But in regard theſe things were commonly practis'd as well in other Nations, as among the Primitive Nations, who conform'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſeveral things, It is not a thing to be eaſily affirm'd, that theſe were the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of thoſe Ceremonies receiv'd ſo many Ages before from
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59633:110"/>
the <hi>Jews.</hi> For not onely the <hi>Jews,</hi> but ſeveral other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made uſe of Circumciſion, and ſtill ſo do to this day, tho not out of any knowledge of its Original, or any Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Divine Worſhip.

Beſides, there is a great difference between the Circumciſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> and that of other Nations. For other Nations onely round the Skin with the Knife, but the <hi>Jews</hi> ſlit the Skin with their nailes, till the <hi>Prepution</hi> falls down, and leaves the <hi>Nut</hi> altogether bare; for unleſs there be <hi>Perignah denudation,</hi> they do not think the Circumciſion accompliſh'd. For ſo their Doctors teach, <hi>Who circumciſes and does not lay bare, is as one that never circumcis'd.</hi> So that if the Skin ſhould happen to grow together again, it muſt be again diſſected. Whence it is eaſier to underſtand what is meant by thoſe Places in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which mention the<note n="(h)" place="bottom">If any one be Circumciſed, let him not draw over, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> drawing over of his <hi>Preputium.</hi> For being cut off, it can never be reſtored by any Art, but being onely ſlit or torn, it may be ſowed together again. Whence
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59633:111"/>
it is eaſie to find that the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> do not uſe the ſame manner of Circumciſing with the <hi>Jews.</hi> Neither is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with any ſignal Ceremony or Commmemoration. For it is done privately by ſome poor woman or other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Standers by, not ſo much as the Father himſelf. But the Confeſſion of <hi>Claudius</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> takes away all doubt, who to clear himſelf and his people from all Suſpition of Judaiſme, ſays thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as to the Cuſtome of Circumciſion, we do not Circumciſe like the</hi> Jews, <hi>For we underſtand the words of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>the Fountain of Wiſdome, who ſaith,</hi> It profits not to be Circumcis'd, <hi>nor doth Circumciſion avail: but rather the new Creation, which is Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And then to the</hi> Corinthians <hi>he ſayes, again, who hath taken upon him Circumciſion,</hi>
                     <note n="(i)" place="bottom">The Printed Copy varies from this, where the words are more obſcure. <hi>If any one goes in uncircumciſed, let him not go forth.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>let him not keep his Preputium. All the Books of St.</hi> Pauls <hi>learning are among us, and tell us of Circumciſion and the Preputium; but our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is done according to the cuſtom of the Countrey, like inciſions of the Face in</hi> Ethiopia <hi>and</hi> Nubia, <hi>and boaring the Ears among the</hi> Indians.</p>
                  <p>This puts us in mind of the Circumciſion of Females, of which <hi>Gregory</hi> was ſomewhat aſham'd to diſcourſe, and we ſhould have more willingly omitted it, had not <hi>Tzaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaabus</hi> in his rude Confeſſion of Faith, ſpoken of it as of a moſt remarkable Cuſtom introduced by the command of Queen <hi>Maqueda;</hi> or had not <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> himſelf, Biſhop of <hi>Como,</hi> inſiſted in the ſame manner upon this unſeemly Cuſtome. This ſame Ceremony was not onely us'd by the <hi>Habiſsines,</hi> but alſo familiar among other people of <hi>Africa</hi> the <hi>(k) Aegyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> themſelves. For they cut away from the Female Infants ſomething which they think to be an Indecency and Superfluity of Nature. The moſt impudent women that inhabit about the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> ſtill retain this Cuſtome, and for a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, expoſe themſelves to the Sea-men. <hi>Jovius</hi> calls it, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runniculam,</hi> or a little <hi>piece of Fleſh. Golius,</hi> an oblong Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The <hi>Arabians</hi> by a particular word called it <hi>Bedhron</hi> or <hi>Bedhara,</hi> beſide which they have many other words to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59633:111"/>
the ſame purpoſe. Among their Women it is as great a piece of reproach, to revile a woman by ſaying to her, <hi>O Bandaron:</hi> that is, <hi>O uncircumcis'd,</hi> as to call a man <hi>Arel,</hi> or <hi>uncircumcis'd</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> A ſtrange thing, that onely in <hi>Africa</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Women ſhould be noted for thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberancies: for the Jewiſh women in <hi>Germany,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted by their reading with this Cuſtome, laugh at it, as admiring what it ſhould be that ſhould require ſuch an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs this ſeems to have ſome reference to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden uſe of Swines Fleſh, and other Meats not allow'd by the Moſaic Law, as the ſame King <hi>Claudius</hi> manifeſtly gives us to underſtand in his Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as to what relates to the Eating of Swines Fleſh, we are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it, out of regard to the obſervance of the Moſaic Law, as the</hi> Jews <hi>were. For we do not abhor him that feeds upon it; nor do we force him that does not, to make it his diet, as our Father</hi> Paul <hi>writing to the</hi> Romans <hi>hath written. Who eats, let him not contemn him that eateth not, for the Lord accepts all. The Kingdom of Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in meat or drink. But it is not good for a man to eat to the ſcandal of another: And</hi> Matthew <hi>the Evangeliſt ſayes, Nothing can defile a man but that which goeth out of his mouth. For what ever goeth into the belly, and is retain'd in the ſtomach, that at length is caſt into the Draught. And thus he pronounces all meat clean. Now while he ſpoke thoſe words he deſtroy'd the whole ſtructure of the</hi> Jews <hi>Error, who were learned in the Books of the Moſaic Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt Nations have a particular Dyet, ſome by cuſtome, ſome through ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſpeak of the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> who abſtain not only from Swines fleſh, but from Wine, is not the cuſtom of the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> not much different from the ancient <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> to be ſtrangely admir'd? who onely feed upon Herbs and Meats made of Milk, which we hardly believe ſufficient to ſuſtain Nature. Others there are that devour all ſorts of Creatures which the fleſh conſuming Beaſts themſelves refuſe, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe nauſeous to the moſt part of Men. The Oriental <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> feed upon Camels, Foxes and all ſorts of wild Beaſts. Some of our <hi>Europeans</hi> indulging their appetites, pleaſe their palats with a ſort of Dyet abominated by all other People, as Frogs, Cockles, and I know not what ſort of Inſects. <hi>Gregory</hi> had
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59633:112"/>
an utter averſion to Lobſters, Crabbs, Crayfiſh and Oyſters, which we accompt our chiefeſt Delicacies: and it turn'd his ſtomach to ſee Turkies, Hares, and ſeveral other Diſhes to which he was unaccuſtom'd, brought to our Tables. Being ask'd, why he abſtain'd from Swines fleſh? he retorted ſtill, and <hi>why we from Horſe-fleſh?</hi> And moſt certainly were we to banquet with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> there are but very few of us that would eaſily be induc'd to eat Horſe-fleſh with an Appetite, tho it be one of their principal junkets. Nay their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to our Princes deſire fat Horſes for their Kitchins.</p>
                  <p>However they abſtain from blood and things ſtrangl'd, not out of any obſervance of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, but an Apoſtolic Decree always in force in the Eaſtern Church: which was alſo for many Ages obſerv'd in the Weſtern Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd in ſome Councils. They alſo rebuke us, for that we ſuffer'd that Decree to be laid aſide.</p>
                  <p>Nor do they allow the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabboth out of a reſpect to Judaiſm, or that they learnt it from ſome certain Nations that kept the Seventh day holy. But becauſe the ancient Cuſtom of the Primitive Church, who obſerv'd that day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps out of complacency to the <hi>Jews,</hi> being long retain'd in the Eaſt, was at length carry'd into <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> For thus we find it written in ſome <hi>ancient Conſtitutions</hi> which they call the Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the Servants labour five days, but let them keep the Holydays, the Sabboth, and the Lords Day in the Church for the ſake of Pious Inſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> decreed that the Goſpels with other parts of Scripture ſhould be read upon the Sabboth; when before the Paragraphs of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were onely read upon the Sabboth, and the <hi>Goſpels</hi> upon the Sunday: the Texts of the old Law being thought moſt agreeable to the Old Sabboth, and the Texts of the New Teſtament, to the New Sabboth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Socrates</hi> alſo farther teſtifies that the People us'd to aſſemble at Church upon the Sabboth and Lords Day.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> whoſe Writings the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> have among them, ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With what Eyes dost thou behold the Lords Day, who hast defil'd
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59633:112"/>
the Sabboth? Know'ſt thou not that theſe two days are Twins, and that if thou injur'st the one, thou dost injury to the other?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Claudius</hi> makes ſo much difference between both days, that he prefers the Lords day before the Sabaoth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as to what pertains to our Celebration of the ancient Sabaoth, we do not celebrate it, as the Jews did, who Crucify'd Christ, ſaying,</hi> Let his blood be upon Us and our Children. <hi>For thoſe Jews neither draw water, nor kindle fires, nor dreſs meat, nor bake bread; neither do they go from houſe to houſe. But we ſo celebrate it, that we administer the Sacrament, and relieve the Poor and the Widow, as our Fathers the Apoſtles commanded Us. We Celebrate it as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth of the firſt Holiday, which is a new day of which</hi> David <hi>ſaith,</hi> This is the day which the Lord made, let us rejoyce and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult therein. <hi>For upon that day our Lord Jeſus Chriſt roſe: and upon that day the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon the Apoſtles in the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Sion. And in that day Chriſt was incarnated in the Womb of the Perpetual Virgin St.</hi> Mary: <hi>and upon that day he ſhall come again to reward the Just, and puniſh the Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> alſo teſtify'd, That the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> abſtain from no ſort of Labour upon the Sabaoth, but from the moſt ſervile ſorts of Labour. This Cuſtom continu'd long in the Church, till it was abrogated by degrees; for by the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                     <hi>Canon</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi> the Chriſtians are forbid to work upon the Sabaoth. Nevertheleſs the Sacred Lectures were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd for a time, as appears by the Canon above mention'd, till at length thoſe were alſo left off; perhaps becauſe that the People having a licence to work, there were but few that repair'd to Church.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Abeſsinia</hi> to marry the Widow of the Brother deceas'd, as <hi>Alvarez</hi> teſtifies. Adding, That the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> defend their ſo doing by the Laws of the Old Teſtament. But <hi>Gregory</hi> poſitively deny'd that it was lawful, but onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd at by the Magiſtrate. However, that ſuch Wives are alſo prohibited from coming to the Holy Communion, wherein <hi>Alvarez</hi> agrees with him. However it does not therefore follow, that this Cuſtom was tranſlated from the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> no more then if any one ſhould aſſert
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59633:113"/>
that the Laws of Polygamie and Divorce were deriv'd from the <hi>Jews.</hi> And yet this is ſomewhat ſtrange, I muſt confeſs, that they abſtain from that Muſcle, which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call <hi>Ghid Hanneſheh,</hi> or the <hi>Sinew</hi> mutilated: the <hi>Ethiopians, Sereje Berum, the forbidden Nerve:</hi> the <hi>Amharies, Shalada.</hi> Which very probably they might learn from the <hi>Jews</hi> in their own Country, of which Nation there are ſeveral Colonies in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as to what is reported concerning Queen <hi>Candaces</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, we have already ſhew'd that ſhe was not Queen of <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> but of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> that inhabited the Iland of <hi>Meroe:</hi> and if the Eunuch were a <hi>Jew,</hi> it does not follow that his Lady the Queen ſhall be ſo too. Others there are who tell us. That <hi>Menilehec</hi>'s Succeſſors in a ſhort time return'd to the worſhip of Idols. Which if it be true, the aſſertion of the Continuation of the Jewiſh Religion till the time of the Apoſtles, will prove altogether vain: tho in <hi>Europe</hi> moſt certainly the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> were long ſuſpected of Judaiſme, and ſo are many to this day. Which King <hi>Claudius</hi> obſerving by his Diſputations with <hi>Gonſalo Rodriguez,</hi> and the Writings which he compos'd to refute the Errors of the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> ſet forth a Confeſſion, of which we have already cited ſeveral parcels, as they related to our buſineſs. The chief Scope of which was, to remove that Suſpition of Judaiſm from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Subjects, which in my opinion he very effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Converſion of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The Converſion of the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> attributed to Queen <hi>Candace</hi>'s Eunuch; but contrary to authentic Hiſtories. <hi>Candace</hi> no <hi>Habeſſinian.</hi> Other Traditions nothing better. Demonſtrated when, and by whom: To which the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Axuma</hi> agrees. The Reaſons of doubting and deciding, <hi>Frumentius</hi> how call'd. His Encomium. <hi>Cedrenus</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> refuted.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is the Common Fame among the <hi>Europeans,</hi> That the Converſion of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by that <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.27. And perhaps the <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines</hi> themſelves, believing it to be for their Honour, were the authors of the Story: confiding in the Credit of the Book of <hi>Axuma,</hi> where, the ſame hiſtory is ſet down as in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and without any other Circumſtances: by which it may ſeem this ſtory had not its firſt original among them, but was tranſcrib'd. Neither was <hi>Tzagazaabus</hi> better inform'd, as appears by his Confeſſion of Faith. Nevertheleſs it ſeems very ſtrange, that King <hi>David</hi> ſhould either aſſert or give his aſſent to <hi>Alvarez</hi> aſſerting the ſame thing: whereas the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as well of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> as <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtory abſolutely tells us the contrary. Some endeavour a Reconciliation of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as if the firſt dawnings of Chriſtianity, tho but very dark and obſcure, began at that time firſt to glimmer. But then this ſhould have bin demonſtrated by ſolid Reaſons rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting not onely to the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Nation in general, but to the <hi>Habeſsinians</hi> in particular. Whereas the Teſtimonies which we ſhall cite by and by do not ſpeak of the Converſion of thoſe that were half Chriſtians before, but either of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Heathens.</hi> For we have already ſhew'd that <hi>Candaces</hi> was never Queen of the <hi>Habeſsines.</hi> Neither is her Proper Name <hi>Lacaſa,</hi> which we find in the Vulgar Catalogues to be found in <hi>Tellezius.</hi> For <hi>Hhendaqe,</hi> or <hi>Hindaqe,</hi> is a quite different word from <hi>Candace,</hi> from whence others caſting away the Aſpirate, derive the name <hi>Judith:</hi> others, as if they would correct the Error, have ſtrain'd it to <hi>Judith.</hi> Nor was the name of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace</hi> ever known to the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> tho familiar to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59633:114"/>
of <hi>Meroe.</hi> Others refer the Converſion of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſsines</hi> not to <hi>Candace</hi>'s Eunuch, but to the times of the Apoſtles, and particularly aſcribe it to St. <hi>Bartholmew:</hi> others to St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> or becauſe there is no ſuch thing to be found in his life, to St. <hi>Matthias.</hi> Of all which Fancies the <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines</hi> knew nothing, who hearing ſuch Whimſeys from our Countreymen, not without reaſon anſwer'd, <hi>That perhaps thoſe things were to be understood of the Lower</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>that lyes between</hi> Abaſſia <hi>and</hi> Egypt. However we can never find out what the Succeſs of thoſe Apoſtles Preaching was: what Kings or People withſtood that Converſion: what Paſtors, what Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, what Books they made uſe of: what form of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or what was the Doctrine of that time. Concerning all which things, in regard there is ſo deep a ſilence, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acknowledg any ſuch beginnings of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However this is certain, That both the <hi>Habeſsine, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, Eſpecially <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and his followers, agree with one conſent, That the Converſion of the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the time of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, about the Year of Chriſt 330. or not long after, and that in this manner. One <hi>Meropius,</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Tyre, (Ruffinus</hi> calls him a Philoſopher) intending for <hi>India,</hi> put into Harbour upon the Coaſt of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> in the Red Sea, which at that time was alſo call'd the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea. There dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or, as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> will have it, ſlain by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he left two Young men, <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Adeſius, Fremonatum</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dracum,</hi> the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> call them, who being taken and brought to the King, became highly favour'd and careſs'd by reaſon of their Ingenuity and Induſtry; and at length being made free of the Country, were preferr'd by the King to keep his Books and Papers. The King dying, they remain'd in the ſame Imployment under the Queen Regent, till the Young King came of age.</p>
                  <p>All this while they entertain'd the Chriſtian Merchants that Traffick'd into thoſe Parts, with all kindneſs, and did them all the good offices Imaginable, and made themſelves ſo remarkable for their Vertue and their Integrity among thoſe Nations, that the Chriſtian Religion was highly eſteem'd by all. Which foundation being laid, <hi>Frumentius</hi> took a Journey to St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and was by Him, for his great parts, and Conſtancy in the Faith,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59633:114"/>
created the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Thereupon returning into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> he initiated the Inhabitants in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Baptiſme, then he ordain'd Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, built Churches, and ſo introduc'd the Chriſtian Religion into <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Agreeable to this, are thoſe Relations which the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> have in their Book of <hi>Axuma,</hi> onely that there is this addition to the Story of the Converſion made by <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace,</hi> that theſe <hi>Tyrian</hi> Young men admir'd, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſhould believe in Chriſt and adore the Holy Trinity, and that the Women wore Croſſes upon their heads, ſeeing that the Goſpel had bin preach'd among them by none of the Apoſtles. We wonder much more, that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> ſhould be converted in the time of the Apoſtles, and yet have no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, no Baptiſm, no Prieſts nor Deacons, and that all theſe things ſhould be firſt ſettled in the time of St. <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, no man can be eaſily perſwaded that ſuch a beginning ſhould remain ſo long time without a farther progreſs, and that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> themſelves, or the Biſhops of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Chriſtians ſhould be ſo neglectful as not to lend their helping hands to the advancement of ſuch fair Beginnings, Eſpecially at ſuch a time, when the Chriſtians over the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, chiefly in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſuffer'd a moſt dreadful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution under <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> How came it to paſs that they did not ſeek for refuge in this Kingdom out of the reach of their Enemies, where they were ſure of Sanctuary and Protection from a Prince of their own Religion? Could all the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſtories, and the Annals of the Patriarch of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> have forgotten a Prince, the firſt in all the World that had receiv'd the light of the Goſpel? Were there no Martyrs, whoſe memories the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> are ſo ſollicitous to preſerve? No War, no Seditions upon the change of Religion, but ſo great an Alteration without any noiſe? To aſſert a thing of ſo much moment, and yet to bring no Circumſtances, no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Events and Caſualties, ſeems very diſcrepant from the Truth of Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>It is ſufficient that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> agree with us in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal matters. For whether <hi>Meropius</hi> dy'd or were ſlain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Edeſius</hi> were call'd <hi>Fremonatus</hi> and <hi>Sydrac,</hi> ſignifies little. Yet in that Place <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. For he ſeems with others to have meant <hi>India</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo call'd, when he neither knew the Bounds or Situation of it, where he ſayes, That the Hithermoſt <hi>India</hi> adjoyns to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59633:115"/>
                     <hi>Ethiopia:</hi> Between which and <hi>Parthia</hi> he places the farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>India.</hi> So that he makes the farthermoſt <hi>India</hi> neareſt to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Parthia</hi> more remote. This was the reaſon that <hi>Baronius</hi> believ'd there were two <hi>Frumentius</hi>'s; and that one was a Preacher of the Goſpel at <hi>Axuma:</hi> whereas it was but one and the ſame perſon, that was Apoſtle and Biſhop of the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> call them <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Axumites,</hi> which you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>This reconciliation of differing Writers was not known till this time, nor does he undeſervedly give the honour of the diſcovery to the Jeſuites: and that then and not before the Chriſtian Religion was firſt introduc'd in <hi>Form,</hi> as he calls it; as being led by tradition alſo, that Chriſtianity had ſome kind of bloomings before in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> But what it was, or to what growth it arriv'd, there is no man that can unfold. Neither does <hi>Ruffinus</hi> make mention of any Jewiſh Religion, or any other deformed Sect that preceded. On the contrary, to uſe his own rough expreſſion, he ſayes, <hi>That this Land</hi> (meaning <hi>Abaſsia) was never broken up with the Plough-ſhare of perſonal Preaching.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Gregory</hi> affirm'd to me, that there was not any other Preaching of the Goſpel in <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> then what was firſt begun by <hi>Abba Salma,</hi> in the time of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and in the Reigns of <hi>Atzbeha,</hi> and <hi>Abreha,</hi> Brethren. And this <hi>Abba Salma</hi> was <hi>Frumentius.</hi> He is celebrated among the Metropolitans of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Liturgie, as alſo by our <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Poet, as being the firſt that diſplay'd the light of the Goſpel in thoſe Parts; for which he gives him this Encomium.</p>

Their Inſtitutions and Habits different from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> They practice Husbandry, and bear Civil Offices.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Converſion of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> being thus begun by <hi>Frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> many Pious men, partly call'd by him to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and partly of their own accord, repair'd thither to Him. We find in the Chronicle of <hi>Axuma,</hi> that in the Raign of King <hi>Amiamid,</hi> the Son of <hi>Saladoba,</hi> many Monks came from <hi>Rome,</hi> and grew very Numerous in the Country. But by the name of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> mean the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>

                  <p>Beſides theſe, there are ſeveral other great Doctors among them, who have highly merited for propagating the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; as alſo many Martyrs, frequently celebrated by the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Coptices</hi> in their Religious Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. But as to their Saints, they relate of them, ſeveral Miracles more than Extraordinary: as the <hi>removing Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, appeaſing the rage of most Tempestuous Seas; raiſing the Dead; cauſing Water to ſpring from ſmitten Rocks, and walking over Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> which are reported for common Miracles among them: ſo that if the Truth of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Church were to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon ſuch Wonders, there could be no purer Religion in the World. For tho we have a <hi>St. Martin,</hi> that gave a piece of his Cloak to one in neceſſity, they have among 'em a Saint, that parted with his whole Garment to relieve the diſtreſſed. There are among them not onely ſeveral Stories of perſons <hi>that have walk'd upon the Aſp and the Baſilisk, and trampled upon the Dragon and the Lyon,</hi> but alſo thoſe who have rode upon thoſe Beaſts, as upon Horſes and Mules. Never were the <hi>Aſcetae</hi> more auſtere. There are ſome who have liv'd for whole days together upon three little Dates, others upon no more than one poor little dry Bisket.</p>
                  <p>But there is not one more renowned for Sanctity among them, then <hi>Gabra-Menfes-Keddus,</hi> or the <hi>Servant of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in honour of whom they keep a Holyday every month.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:59633:117"/>Next to him is <hi>Tecla-Haimanot,</hi> or the <hi>Plant of Faith,</hi> who reſtor'd the Monaſtical way of Living, in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> about the Year of Chriſt 600. Whom the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Poet extolls in a moſt ſingular manner.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>All hail to thy Navity, great Saint,</l>
                     <l>It was at first thy Mothers great Complaint,</l>
                     <l>That ſhe ſhould barren dye, till th' Angels Voice</l>
                     <l>Declar'd thy Birth, and made her Son rejoyce.</l>
                     <l>Then <hi>Tecla-Haimanot</hi> Thou didſt appear</l>
                     <l>Like to the Sun, that rules the Day and Year:</l>
                     <l>Thy Glory fill'd the Earth from end to end,</l>
                     <l>And to the Heavens thy Luſter did aſcend.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This Auſtere way of Living was firſt practiz'd in <hi>Thebais;</hi> a Deſert of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whither many Pious men had retir'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Perſecution of the Heathen, that through abſtinence and temperance they might be more intent upon the Duty of Prayer. Among the reſt, St. <hi>Antonie,</hi> as it were the Captain of the Hermites, preſcrib'd certain Lawes to be obſerv'd by the Profeſſors of this ſort of ſeverity: for which reaſon, next to <hi>Paul,</hi> he was look'd upon as its firſt Inſtitutor. The Affairs of the Church being ſettl'd, many <hi>Anchorites,</hi> in imitation of him, voluntarily choſe a ſolitary way of Living: for that reaſon call'd <hi>Monachi, Monks,</hi> or People that liv'd alone by themſelves. Some meerly out of a Pious and godly end; ſome out of an opinion of merit; ſome out of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory and a deſire of worldly fame; becauſe they found that auſterity of life, as being a thing hard to be undergone, was vulgarly much admir'd and highly applauded. Many alſo did not think it ſufficient to abſtain from lawful enjoyments, or to bridle and reſtrain the ordinary deſires of Nature, but voluntarily tormented themſelves with new invented Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or macerated themſelves with hunger and famine. This Cuſtome ſpread it ſelf alſo into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where ſome without any advantage to themſelves or others, invented ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways of afflicting their own Carcaſſes: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>To ſtand whole days together in cold water, to gird their Loyns with a heavy Chain, to feed onely upon Pot-herbs and Roots,</hi> and that very ſparingly too.

                  </p>
                  <p>Of him the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Poet thus ſings:
<q>
                        <l>Hail to thy pretious Mantle, once the Boate,</l>
                        <l>Which with thy Burden on the Sea did floate;</l>
                        <l>Thy Pilgrimage a mighty Wonder ſhew'd,</l>
                        <l>Th'Obedient Ocean ſmooth and ſmiling ſlow'd</l>
                        <l>And Rocks remov'd, abandon'd ancient Reſt,</l>
                        <l>To give free Paſſage where thy footſteps preſt.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He alſo preſcrib'd Laws to his followers, but impos'd no Governour upon them, neither are they very ſolicitous about that neglect; pretending, <hi>That</hi> Euſtathius <hi>went into</hi> Armenia, <hi>having nam'd no Succeſſor; and that therefore it is not lawful for them to appoint any one.</hi> Every Abbot therefore is Supreme in his own Monaſtery; and if any one dye, another is choſen by the Suffrages of the reſt of the Monks. <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> is full of theſe ſort of people, to the great burthen of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to which they are no way profitable; as being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the Field, and free from Tribute. However their Rules and Orders are very much different both from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins.</hi> For excepting their <hi>Sheemas</hi> and Croſſes which they carry, you can hardly diſtinguiſh them from the Laitie: in regard they neither wear any <hi>Coat</hi> or Monaſtical Habit. Nor do they live in Monaſteries, but in ſome Village in ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Cottages near to ſome Church or Temple. They have certain Prayers of which they ſay ſuch a number, believing their Piety fully ſatisfy'd if they finiſh their Task; which that they may make the more haſt to accompliſh, they huddle over the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> with ſuch a dextrous celerity, that I who have heard 'em at <hi>Rome,</hi> holding the ſame Copy in my hand, could never follow them with my voice, and hardly with my eyes. Every one manures his own Ground, and lives upon the product of his Labours, of which they are alſo very liberal. Otherwiſe they go and come, every one without controul, as they pleaſe themſelves. So that by no means
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59633:119"/>
their Farms can be call'd Cloyſters, nor they be ſaid to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Monks, but onely unmarried Husbandmen, and that onely while they preſerve their Continency intire. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are branded with infamy, if they forſake their Monaſtical way of living to marry Wives. Nor are their Children capable of being admitted into the Clergy; and it is taken for an affront to call any man the Son of a Monk. Nevertheleſs they bear Civil Offices, and are ſometimes made Governors of Provinces, as is apparent by the Example of <hi>Tzagazaabus;</hi> who was a Monk, as appears from <hi>Alvarez</hi>'s Itinerary. Of ſuch as theſe the Queſtion may be ask'd with St. <hi>Jerome, If thou deſireſt to be accompted a Monk, what doest thou do in the Cities, what in the Camp, or why dost thou undertake Civil Employments?</hi> They could not chooſe but highly diſpleaſe the Fathers of the Society; which is the reaſon, that they have always ſpoken of them with contempt: on the other ſide, the Monks have bin the main Obſtacles of the Fathers Succeſſes; for which Reaſon, <hi>Tellezius</hi> calls them Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Catholic Faith. Their Monaſteries (if we may ſo call their Villages) are very numerous and diſpierc'd over all Parts of the Kingdom: and commonly go by the name of <hi>Daber,</hi> a Mountain; in the plural number <hi>Adebaruti,</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: as, <hi>Dabra Bizen, Dabra Hallelujah, Dabra Damo, Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> and the like, as being formerly built upon ſteep Hills: Beſide which, they poſſeſs all the Ilands in the <hi>Tzanic Lake,</hi> except <hi>Deka.</hi>

                     <p>THat there are alſo Nuns in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> I gather from <hi>Telle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius.</hi> But they are very ignorant, and therefore the more obſtinate in their devotion.

                  </head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> together with the Chriſtian Religion, receiv'd the Holy Scripture, according to the Verſion of the <hi>70</hi> Interpreters—the New Testament from an Imperfect Copy and ill Printed. The Old Testament divided into four parts: The New Testament into as many- The <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> added as an Appendix. To the New Testament are added the Conſtitutions and Canons of the Apoſtles, as they call them, divided into Eight parts: Therefore they reckon ſeveral Sacred Books. Three Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Councils. A fair Manuſcript of the Councils at <hi>Rome.</hi> Books therein contain'd. A Counterfeit Book of <hi>Enoch.</hi> Magical Prayers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Monſtrous words ſeeming to be taken from the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Form of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Anathematizing.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>DIvine Worſhip</hi> is ſeldom found among any ſort of Nations in the World to be without Books, by which we apprehend from whence every particular kind of worſhip derives it ſelf, and by what means it got footing among the People: for the words and the worſhip generally go together. Which is the reaſon there are ſo many Hebrew and Greek words in all the Verſions of the Bible, and that we have ſo many Latin words in our Theologie.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Habeſsines</hi> together with the Chriſtian Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the holy Scripture. And this Scripture was tranſlated into that Idiom of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Language, which was at that time more peculiar to the Inhabitants of <hi>Tigra,</hi> from the Greek Verſion of the Seventy Interpreters, according to a certain Copy us'd in the Church of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59633:120"/>
various Readings, that are inſerted into the <hi>Engliſh Polyglòtton</hi> Bibles, from one of the ſame Copies, plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, with which the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Tranſlation perfectly agrees, Eſpecially in the 35 &amp; 39 Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> which in other Copies are wonderfully mutilated. Nor is it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon that a Colonie, as it were, of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church, ſhould follow the Sacred Copies of their <hi>Metropolis.</hi> As for the Author and Time of the Tranſlation, I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certainly deliver'd concerning either: however it is moſt probable that it was begun at the time when the <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines</hi> were<note n="(f)" place="bottom">There is one who has written a certain <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Martyrologie, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, That <hi>Frumentius,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Abba-Salama,</hi> was the Author of the firſt Tranſlation; but before I ſee it, I will not undertake to affirm it.</note> converted, or a very ſhort time after, and not in the time of the Apoſtles, as ſome have reported; and brought to perfection by ſeveral; becauſe the more rare and difficult words, ſuch as are the names of Gemms, are not all alike in all the Books. For example, the <hi>Topaz</hi> in the 118 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 127 <hi>Verſe,</hi> is call'd <hi>Pazjon,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 28.19. <hi>Tankar,</hi> in <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> the 21.20. <hi>Warauri:</hi> and ſo in many other words the ſame difference is obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>But for the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> they have it Tranſlated from the Authentic Greek Text, tho as yet it has not bin brought into <hi>Europe</hi> pure and intire. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition is printed from a lame imperfect Copy, ſo that I was forc'd to fill up the Gapps which <hi>Tesfa-Tzejon</hi> had left, from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Exemplars. This was obſerv'd by ſome Learned Men, but not underſtanding the Cauſe, it made them think that the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Verſion had bin drawn from the Vulgar Latin. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they did not underſtand theſe following <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Lines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe Acts of the Apoſtles, for the most part, were tranſlated at</hi> Rome <hi>out of the Latin, and Greek, for want of the</hi> Ethiopic <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. For what we have added or omitted, we begg your pardon, and request of You to mend what is amiſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More then this, the Publiſher of the Book beggs pardon, and excuſes the defect of the Edition, in regard of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Aſſiſtants which he had to help him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fathers and Brethren, be pleas'd not to interpret amiſs the faults
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59633:120"/>
of this Edition; for they who Compos'd it could not read; and for our ſelves we know not how to compoſe. So then we help'd them, and they aſsiſted us, as the blind leads the blind; and therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to pardon us and them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Excuſe he alſo repeats in other places, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of its being defective in ſeveral other places. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the ſame Edition was afterwards printed in <hi>England,</hi> as an addition to that famous <hi>Poly Glotton;</hi> of which there is no other reaſon to be given, but that there was no other to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.</p>
                  <p>However they enjoy the holy Scripture entire, and reck'n as many Books as we do, tho they divide them after another manner. For they diſtinguiſh the Old Teſtament, which contains 46 Books into four Principal parts; to which they joyn certain other Books of a different Argument conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more, perhaps, the Convenience of the Volumes, then the Dignity of the Matter. They alſo mix the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> with the Canonical, whether out of Careleſneſs or Ignorance is uncertain. And as for <hi>Gregory,</hi> he plainly confeſs'd he had never heard of any ſuch word as <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>

                  <p>To which they add as a Supplement, the <hi>Viſion of John,</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Abukalamſis:</hi> A word corrupted out of the Greek <hi>Apocalypſis,</hi> which they ignorantly took for the Sirname of St. <hi>John,</hi> as compounded of the Arabic word <hi>Abu</hi> &amp; <hi>Kalamſis.</hi> Here we are to obſerve, that in the written Eaſtern Copies, the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are found ſingle by themſelves; and this is the reaſon that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Copy of the <hi>Ethiopic New Teſtament,</hi> they were Printed apart, and not in the Order by us obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> they generally annex a Volume, which they call, according to the Greek word, <hi>Synodum,</hi> or the <hi>Book of Synods.</hi> It contains thoſe moſt ancient Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are call'd the <hi>Conſtitutions of the Apoſtles:</hi> in their Language <hi>Tazazate, Precepts,</hi> or <hi>Canons,</hi> being an Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the Primitive Rites and Ceremonies, written by the Induſtry of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> but they are very much different from thoſe that are diſpers'd among Us under the name of the Apoſtles. Theſe the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> divide into eight parts, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall to the Canonical Writings of the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, as it were certain <hi>Novels,</hi> as if they were of the ſame Authority, and the moſt abſolute Pandects of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence it was, that King <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Alvareſius,</hi> That he had Fourſcore and one Books of Sacred Scripture; that is to ſay, Six and forty of Old Teſtament (reck'ning the <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> by themſelves), and Thirty five of the New Teſtament, adding to the <hi>Twenty ſeven,</hi> thoſe Eight Books of Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Canons, which the Ethiopians call <hi>Manda</hi> &amp; <hi>Abte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> the Signification of which were unknown to <hi>Gregory,</hi> as being words altogether Exotic. This was alſo the reaſon why <hi>Tefa-Tzejon</hi> has this Expreſſion in the Title of the New Teſtament, <hi>I have caus'd a New Copy to be Printed, but without a Synod,</hi> becauſe he did not Print together with the ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, thoſe Canons and Inſtitutions before ſpecify'd. Next to this Book which is alſo call'd <hi>Hadas,</hi> or abſolutely <hi>New,</hi> the chiefeſt Reverence is given to the three Oecumenic Councils, the <hi>Nicene, Constantinopolitan,</hi> and <hi>Epheſine,</hi> with ſome other Provincial Councils, which were receiv'd in the Church till the <hi>Schiſm</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> But we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that beſide the Twenty <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Greek and Latin Church, they alſo admit of Eighty four other Canons, which are extant among the Copies in the Arabic Language. And theſe in the foregoing Century, <hi>Baptiſta</hi> the Jeſuit Tranſcrib'd and brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were Tranſlated into Latin.

is call'd <hi>Organon Denghel, The Virgins Muſical Inſtrument,</hi> Compoſed by <hi>Abba George,</hi> an <hi>Abaſsine</hi> Doctor, a Book not very ancient, but in high eſteem by reaſon of the great number of Similitudes and Allegories; as alſo for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of the ſtile and words.

So ſoon as that noble Gentleman heard of this Book, he ſpar'd for no Coſt to get it into his hands; till at length the Knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe he employ'd, impos'd upon him another Book with a falſe Title. The Book was afterwards lodg'd in Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Library, and the Preface, Middle and End being Tranſcrib'd by a Friend of mine, was preſented to me, but there was nothing in it either of <hi>Enoch</hi> or his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; only ſome few Notions there were, and ſome very clear diſcourſes of the Myſteries of Heaven and Earth, and the Holy Trinity, under the Name of one <hi>Abba-Bahaila-Michael.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Religion of the <hi>Habaſsines</hi> at this Day.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The Reports of <hi>Matthew</hi> the <hi>Armenian</hi> and <hi>Tzagazaab</hi> falſe or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The Fathers have omitted their ſoundeſt Opinions—And fix'd their ſeveral Errors upon them. The Confeſſion of <hi>Claudius</hi> Genuine. The great Authority of the Synodal Writers. They admit the <hi>Nicene</hi> and other Councils till that of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> They acknowledge the Trinity, one Perſon of Chriſt, and his ſufficient Merit. The Proceeding of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son they deny. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s Diſpute and Opinion. The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> interpretation of the word <hi>Proceed.</hi> The Sacraments, Baptiſm, Communion under both Kinds. The real Preſence. The words they uſe in Reference to it. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s Opinion of Tranſubſtantiation. Of the Soul after Death. They pray for the Dead. Deny Purgatory. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s Opinion concerning it. The Original of Prayer for the Dead. They pray to Saints and Angels. Their Catechiſm for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and <hi>Neophytes.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WEre the Symbolical Book of the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> which they call <hi>Hajmanot-Abau</hi> to be found in <hi>Europe,</hi> we might eaſily Collect from thence, the true and genuine Sence and Doctrine of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Church concerning the Heads and Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith: for hitherto we find the moſt of them uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deliver'd, and for the Confeſſion of Faith ſet down by <hi>Matthew</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and <hi>Tzagazaab,</hi> we have already taken notice of the failings in it. The Fathers of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that have been converſant among the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> both in this and the former Century, and frequently diſcours'd with their Learned Men, paſſing by their ſound and ſerious Opinions, tax them of many Errors which they have receiv'd from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> As for Example,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Spirit proceeds only from the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Human Nature of Chriſt is equal to his Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:59633:124"/>
                     <hi>They acknowledge but one Will and one Operation in Chriſt; for which reaſon they believe that we affirm Four Perſons in the Godhead, ſeeing that we confeſs two Wills and two Natures in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They repeat the Ceremony of Baptiſm every year upon the Feaſt of the</hi> Epiphany.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They believe that the Souls of the Juſt ſhall not be receiv'd into Heaven before the end of the World; nor do they think them to be Created, but produc'd out of Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They neither confeſs the Number, nor the particular Species of their Sins, but cry in general, I have ſin'd, I have ſin'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They uſe not the Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Chriſm, nor Extream Unction upon the approach of Death; nor do they mind the Conſolation of the bread of life. Inſomuch that many of them ſtick not to ſay, That they who follow the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, are not only</hi> Heretics, <hi>but worſe than the</hi> Mahumetans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They reject the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>caſting many reproaches upon</hi> Leo <hi>the Great; but highly applauding</hi> Dioſcurus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They deny Purgatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things I choſe to deliver almoſt in the very words of <hi>Godignus,</hi> who Collected them out of the Relations and Letters of <hi>Gonzalez Rodoric, Alphonſus de Franca, Emanuel Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez,</hi> and others of the Society. Neither do they ſeem to be improbable; but how they evade or excuſe them, we ſhall ſhortly declare. As to what is ſaid that ſome of them believe the Followers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion to be worſe than <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> I could not hear any ſuch thing from <hi>Gregory:</hi> neither did he think it was to be underſtood in reference to their Doctrine, but their Tyranny over their Subjects; it being the Cuſtom of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> only to vex and oppreſs all thoſe who are under their Power, profeſſing a Religion contrary to theirs, but never to rage againſt them with Fire and Sword.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time we have a Confeſſion ſet forth by King <hi>Claudius;</hi> but the ſcope of that Confeſſion was only to clear himſelf and his Subjects from the Imputation of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> which he found to be the only reaſon that impeded the Amity between him and the <hi>Portugals.</hi> Therefore leaving this Confeſſion, by what we can gather from their Publick Liturgies, and the Writings and Sayings of Perſons, both Publick and Private, the ſum of the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Doctrine ſeems to conſiſt of the following Heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:59633:125"/>Firſt, They acknowledge the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> to be the ſole and only <hi>Rule</hi> of what they are to believe, and what they are to do: inſomuch that King <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Alvarez,</hi> That if the Pope ſhould impoſe upon Him or His Subjects, any thing what the Apoſtles had not written or permitted, he would not obey him; nor his own <hi>Metropolitan</hi> if he ſhould attempt to do the like. But with the Scripture they are ſo much in love, that there is nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to their Ears, than the repetition of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Tellez,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nothing more pleas'd the</hi> Habeſſines <hi>than to hear the Scripture often quoted in Sermons; and the more Citations a man brings out of Scripture, the more learned be is accompted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor do they give much leſs Credit to the Three Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Councils, as appears by the Confeſſion of <hi>Claudius.</hi> They generally make uſe of the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> which they call <hi>Tzalot Hajmanot, the Prayer of the Faith.</hi> That which we uſe they have not, no more than all the reſt of the Eaſtern Churches; a ſtrong Argument, that it was not compil'd by the Apoſtles, tho' in regard of the Doctrine which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, it may be truly call'd <hi>Apostolic.</hi> For certainly the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Fathers would not have ſtifl'd ſuch a Creed, or ſet forth another of their own, had the Apoſtles left ſuch an Epitome of their Doctrine behind them. The Ancient Greek Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils then are the Councils which the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> have in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, together with the Eighty four ancient Canons added to thoſe of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, till they come to that of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> which they do not only utterly reject, but alſo Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reproach.</p>
                  <p>Whatever therefore the Catholic Church admitted and believ'd before that Council, concerning God, Three in one; the Three diſtinct Perſons in one Eſſence; the Eternity of the Son of God, the Exiſtence of the Holy Ghoſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles of Faith, all thoſe things the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſent to and allow, condemning thoſe that Diſpute againſt them. By the way, we are here to obſerve, that the Ethiopic words, <hi>Sabſatu Gaz Gaz Egza Bahr,</hi> Three Perſons and one God, are vulgarly ill Tranſlated, being to have bin render'd, <hi>Three Faces, One Lord;</hi> for the word <hi>Gaz,</hi> ſignifies as well the <hi>Face</hi> or <hi>Countenance,</hi> as it bears the force of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59633:125"/>The Neſtorian Hereſie aſſerting two Perſons in Chriſt, they ſo abhor, that for that very reaſon they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of his two Natures, and two Wills, tho they poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge his Divinity and Humanity. For they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Chriſt to be true and perfect God; and alſo true and perfect Man, and to conſiſt in one Individual Perſon of Divinity and Humanity, without Confuſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion.</p>
                  <p>Farthermore, They acknowledge the moſt Sacred Merits of Chriſt; to be moſt ſufficient and efficacious for the Sins of the whole world, and conſequently of all Mankind; and this <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf affirm'd to be true: nor have I found in any of their Books which I have happen'd to ſee, any thing that contradicts what he aſſerted. However, as the Greeks do, they deny the Proceeding of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son; yet all this while they acknowledge him to be equally the Spirit of the Father and the Son, and to be a Perſon ſubſiſting of himſelf. For thus they declare in their Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We believe the Father ſending, that the Father is in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And we believe the Son who is ſent, that the Son is in his own Perſon, and we believe the Holy Ghoſt who deſcended upon</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, <hi>and upon the Apoſtles, that the Holy Ghoſt is in his own Perſon; Three Names, One God. Not as</hi> Abraham <hi>who is elder than</hi> Iſaac, <hi>nor as</hi> Iſaac <hi>who is Elder than</hi> Jacob. <hi>It is not ſo, The Father is not Elder than the Son, becauſe he is the Father, nor the Son Elder than the Holy Ghoſt, nor the Holy Ghoſt leſſer or Younger than the Father and the Son, nor is the Son Younger than the Father, becauſe he is the Son. Not as</hi> Abraham <hi>who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over</hi> Iſaac <hi>in reſpect of Generation, becauſe he begat him, nor as</hi> Iſaac <hi>who commanded</hi> Jacob. <hi>It is not ſo in Divinity; The Father does not command the Son, becauſe he is the Father; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Son greater than the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe he is the Son. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are Equal; One God, one Glory, one Kingdom, one Power, one Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But concerning the <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> or Perſon of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> really diſtinct from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Organon</hi> thus diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>But leaſt any one, from what has been already ſaid, ſhould infer, that the Holy Ghoſt is not a perfect and diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59633:126"/>
therefore ſaid Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>I will ſend you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comforter.</hi> By which we know that the Holy Ghoſt doth exiſt together with the Father and the Son, and alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his own proper Subſiſtance or Perſon. Not that the Holy Ghoſt is partly in the Son, partly in his own Perſon, but one and the ſame, exiſtent in his proper Perſon, and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> being ask'd, whether this were the unanimous and conſtant Opinion of all the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Doctors? reply'd, <hi>It was.</hi> I thereupon urg'd, <hi>Why they deny'd that the Holy Ghoſt proceeded from the Father? ſeeing they aſſerted, that he was equally the Spirit of the Father and the Son? He deſir'd, That I would first expound what was meant by Proceeding from the Father,</hi> and then he would give the reaſon of the Denyal; and that for his part, he kept to the words of the Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. and 16.24. <hi>Who goeth out from the Father, and takes from the Son;</hi> and that he ſought no farther. For that it was not lawful in Diſputes concerning the moſt abſtruſe Myſteries of the Holy Trinity, to argue by Conſequences; but to ſtick cloſe to the very words and Expreſſions of Scripture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. That I ſhould conſider what would follow, if we ſhould argue from the Unity and Equality of Eſſence to the Characteriſtical Proprieties of the Perſons. As if any one ſhould undertake to averr, <hi>That Chriſt is the Son of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt is one and Coeternal God with the Father.</hi> Some ſuch kind of Argument his Countryman <hi>Tzagazaab</hi> may be thought to have had in his Brain, when he wrote, That Chriſt was the Son of himſelf, and the Beginning of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he was co-eſſential with the Father, whoſe Son he was. By the way we are to underſtand, That the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> inſtead of the word <hi>Vazzea, went forth or proceeded,</hi> and in the Preterperfect tenſe, uſe the word <hi>Saraz,</hi> to <hi>budd</hi> or <hi>ſprout forth.</hi> Thus <hi>Claudius</hi> in his Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt, reviving Lord,</hi> Zaſratz em Ab, <hi>who proceeded or ſprung from the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They never add from the Son, altho the Liturgy Printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Tzagazaab</hi>'s Confeſſion runs thus, <hi>Zaſraz em Ab vavalde,</hi> who ſprouted forth or proceeded from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. Where 'tis much to be doubted, that <hi>from the Son</hi> was inſerted by another hand</p>
                  <p>We proceed to the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> of which they neither have the common name nor number. For they are utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59633:126"/>
of <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Extreme Unction.</hi> They make uſe of the word <hi>Maſtar,</hi> for a <hi>Myſterie,</hi> whenever they go about to intimate the Myſterie of the Participation of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Otherwiſe they do not think it neceſſary, to ſignifie the <hi>Seals of Faith,</hi> by any other Vulgar name not us'd in Scripture, or to make much diſpute about the Number. Only ſaid <hi>Gregory,</hi> They make uſe of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies anciently made uſe of by the Church. But the Fathers of the Society reported, That the Ceremonies of Baptiſm were ſo deprav'd and corrupted among the <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines,</hi> that they were conſtrain'd to Rebaptize great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers under a Condition.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> they Adminiſter it indifferently to all, both Layety and Clergy, as it is the Cuſtom in all the Churches of the Eaſt. Neither has any thing more alienated their minds from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> than their finding the Layety to be depriv'd of the Cup by the Latins. <hi>Gregory</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what he thought of the real Preſence of the Body and Blood in the <hi>Lord's Supper?</hi> made anſwer, That he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it. Adding withal, according to his manner, when any Diſcourſes aroſe of Matters more difficult and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe than ordinary, <hi>Retzitze nagare vet,</hi> 'tis a nice buſineſs; or, <hi>Maſtar vet, It is a Myſtery.</hi> When I produc'd him theſe words in the Liturgies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lord now lay thy hand upon this Diſh, Bleſs it, Sanctifie it, and Purifie it, that ſo thy Body may be made holy therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lay thy hand upon this Cup, and now bleſs it, ſanctifie it, and purifie it, that thy Blood may become holy therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lay thy hand upon this Spoon of the Croſs, to prepare the Body and Blood of thy only Son our Lord and God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in another place,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Convert this Bread, that it may become thy pure Body, which is joyn'd with this Cup of thy moſt precious Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And out of the Euchariſtic Prayer, which bears the Title of the 318 <hi>Orthodox Divines,</hi> theſe following words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:59633:127"/>
                     <hi>Let the Holy Ghoſt deſcend, and come and ſhine upon this Bread, that it may be made the Body of Christ our Lord, and that the taſte and ſavour of this Cup may be chang'd, that ſo it may be made the Blood of Christ our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when I ask'd him withal the Expoſition of the words <hi>Majete vat valto,</hi> to <hi>be chang'd or converted;</hi> and then demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him, <hi>Whether he did not think that the ſubstance of the Bread and Wine was not chang'd and converted into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Christ?</hi> He made anſwer, <hi>That no ſuch ſort of Tranſubstantiation was known or understood by the</hi> Habeſſines. <hi>That his Countrymen were not ſo ſcrupulous, nor us'd to ſtart ſuch thorny Questions. Nevertheleſs it ſeem'd to him probable and like, that the vulgar Bread and Wine was chang'd into the mysterious Repreſentation of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Christ;</hi> and ſo was alter'd from Prophane to Sacred, to repreſent the true Body and Blood of Chriſt to the Communicants. <hi>Tellez</hi> confeſſes his diſſatisfaction touching their Conſecration, it being their Cuſtom to ſay over the Body of Chriſt, <hi>This bread is my Body;</hi> and over the Wine, <hi>This cup is my Blood.</hi> Which words have not in them the true force of Conſecration. For the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are of Opinion, That whoever ſpeaks thoſe words, does nothing; Theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> being only of Efficacy to operate a true Tranſubſtantiation. Which being true, no man can pretend that the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege Tranſubſtantiation, eſpecially ſeeing they do not attribute thoſe Divine Honours to the Sacraments, which the Conſequences of real Tranſubſtantiation require.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ſtate of the Soul after Death, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Opinions among the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> every one having free Liberty of Opinion in thoſe things that do not directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Eternal Salvation. So that it is no wonder that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny various Sentiments of private perſons are brought away by our Doctors, as the publick Opinions of the <hi>Habeſsines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of them believe that the Souls of Men piouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, ſhall not behold the Beatifical Viſion of God before the Reſurrection of the Body; which is alſo the Opinion of many of the Ancient Latins: as if the Soul remain'd in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Body in ſome certain third place. Others, convinc'd by the Authority of the Scripture, <hi>acknowledge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Manſions of the Souls, Heaven and Hell; believing no Damnatinn to thoſe that are in Chriſt, and dye in his Faith.</hi>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59633:127"/>
Which they gather from the Example of the Penitent Thief, and the words of Chriſt, thus Tranſlated by the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi>
                     <q>Verily I ſay unto thee, firmly believe, that thou ſhalt be with me in Paradice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, as for thoſe that Piouſly ſleep in Chriſt, they believe them not to be in a worſe Condition than this Thief, who at the point of Death was ſav'd through Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence actuated by Faith, without any ſatisfaction given for his Thieveries. Now to prove that the Soul of Man is not created, they produce this Argument, That God perfected the whole Work of his Creation upon the Sixth day. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they believe it to be in its own Nature immortal, as being inſpir'd into Man by God, at his firſt Creation. But on the other ſide, they think it very abſurd that God ſhould be ty'd to create new Souls every day for Adulterate and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Births.</p>
                  <p>However the firſt Opinion ſeems to be the more vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd among them; in regard of their Prayers for the Dead: As for example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember, Lord, the Souls of thy Servants, and our Father,</hi> Abba-Matthew, <hi>and the reſt of our Fathers,</hi> Abba-Salama, <hi>and</hi> Abba-Jacob.</p>
                  <p>And a little after,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember, Lord, the Kings of</hi> Ethiopia, Abreha; <hi>and</hi> Atzbeha, Caleb, <hi>and</hi> Gebra-Meskah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then they add,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Releaſe, O Lord, our Fathers</hi> Abba Antony <hi>and</hi> Abba Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Remember, Lord, the Soul of thy Servant, our Father</hi> Tecla-Hajmanot, <hi>with all his Companions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence it may be fairly juſtify'd, that the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> admit of a <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And yet <hi>Gregory</hi> conſtantly deny'd it. And <hi>Godignus</hi> confeſſes, <hi>That there are no ſacred Services ſaid for the deceas'd among the</hi> Habeſſines. The ſame thing <hi>Tellez</hi> confirms. However he derides them, as not conſtant to themſelves; for that, <hi>to pray for the Dead, and diſtribute Alms
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59633:128"/>
to the Poor, is no other than to aſſert</hi> Purgatory. Nor do I ſee how they can reconcile their Praying for the Reſt of happy Souls; and at another time, their imploring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the ſame Souls.</p>
                  <p>But they nothing mov'd with theſe Arguments and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, affirm them to be <hi>the Pious Conception of their good wiſhes, and only a Commemoration of the happy Eſtate of the deceas'd; and that it is none of their buſineſs to make any farther ſcrutiny into the Traditions of their Anceſtors. Gregory</hi> added, That <hi>many Prayers</hi> of the Chriſtians were ſo conceiv'd, that many times thoſe things were Petition'd for, which were <hi>already perform'd and anſwer'd. That the Lord's Prayer contain'd Petitions of that kind. For that it would be a thing but badly inferr'd, that the Name of God was not Hallow'd, or that his Will was not done both in Heaven and Earth, becauſe we daily put up thoſe Prayers: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we all begg every day for Daily Bread, when moſt of thoſe that make that Prayer, do generally live in wealthy abundance.</hi> He had heard perhaps among us our general good Wiſhes for the departed, That <hi>God would vouchſafe to grant the Interr'd Body a Quiet Repoſe, and at length a joyful Reſurrection.</hi> And thereupon, ſaid he, <hi>Do not you your ſelves wiſh the ſame good wiſhes for the Dead? Do not you believe that the Carkaſſes of the Dead may be vexed with Spiritual Evils? or that a happy Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection may be obtain'd by your Prayers.</hi> And he took ſo heinouſly the ſuſpition of his belief of Purgatory, that he cry'd out, <hi>Would it not be an irreverent Injury to ſo many Kings and Fathers, ſhould we interpret the Commemoration of their Souls to that height, as to think they ſhould be tormented for ſo many Ages in Purgatory, and want the aid of our indefatigable Prayers to releaſe them after ſo long an Impriſonment?</hi> For thoſe Kings and Fathers were men among the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> moſt Innocent, and had bin dead above a Thouſand years ſince or more. So that whether they be in Paradice, or remain in any other place, expecting the Reſurrection of their Bodies, in both caſes Prayers of that Nature ſeem ſuperfluous.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, were there any Queſtion to be made of the happy Condition of Men Piouſly deceas'd, we ſhould rather pray for thoſe whoſe lives were more looſe and vain, than for thoſe whoſe Converſations were without blame. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what has bin deliver'd about the Opinions of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſines</hi> concerning Purgatory, leans rather upon Conjecture than any ſufficient Authority, they being ignorant of the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59633:128"/>
very Name. Inſomuch that <hi>Jacob Wemmers</hi> the <hi>Carmelite,</hi> in his <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Lexicon, was conſtrain'd to forge a Word, by calling it <hi>Mantzehi Hatate,</hi> the Purger of Sin. But we are to underſtand, that it was the moſt Ancient Cuſtom of the Church firſt of all to read the Names of the Holy Martyrs out of the Public Regiſters, as being a Duty owing to the memory of the invincible Teſtimonies for Chriſt. Which the following Ages ſtrain'd another way, as if they had need of our Interceſſion; and others, as if we could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Interceſſion, made it a preſence to invoke the Holy Saints, as if they were preſent and heard them. To which we may add, That the Ancient Chriſtian Orators, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Homilies, making uſe of their Rhetorick, by vertue of that Figure, commonly call'd <hi>Proſopopocia,</hi> beſpoke the bleſſed Saints, and introduc'd them as it were returning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; from whence it is not improbable that Suſpition might introduce the Cuſtom of giving the ſame Adoration to them as to God himſelf, and worſhipping them with Temples, Altars, and other Divine Honours. Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> do not do; for though they keep Holydaies in memory of their Saints, they do not call them <hi>Bagnabat, Solemnities;</hi> but <hi>Tjabarat, Remembrances.</hi> They alſo invoke them, tho they know not after what manner they may be able to hear them; and beg their Interceſſions alſo, eſpecially of the moſt Holy Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom they bear ſuch an affectionate Reverence, that they think whatever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has invented to her Honour, all too little; and yet they erect no Statues to her memory for all that, being contented only with her Pictures. When they were in a rage againſt thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and purſu'd 'em in their fury with Sticks and Stones, they cry'd out, <hi>Kill, Kill; whoever is not an Enemy of</hi> Marie, <hi>let him take up a Stone to ſtone her Enemies to Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more than this, they many times invoke the Angels, as having for that perhaps a more ſpecious pretence, becauſe they have bin frequently ſaid to appear to good Men and Women, and hear their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> reckon no leſs than Nine Orders, which they borrow from their Names and Epithites given them in Sacred Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Malaeket,</hi> Angels particularly ſo call'd, or by another Name, <hi>Manofsat, Spirits; Bitean Malaeket; Arch-Angels.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Church, as alſo of the <hi>Habeſſine</hi> Temples.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Sacred Rites often an Occaſion of Diſturbance in the Church. The Prudent Decree of the Apoſtles. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Condeſcenſion neceſſary. <hi>Judaiſh</hi> Rites retain'd. Many new Ceremonies invented by the Pope, by the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> Metropolitan none. The moſt ancient Ceremonies retain'd by the <hi>Abeſſines.</hi> Their Churches dark, like the Synagogues. The Diviſions of them, and Quires. The Nobility made Deacons. The Biſhops Lodgings. Much honour'd. They admit of Pictures. They ſign with the Croſs. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of grown People. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers why ſo call'd. The Euchariſt given to baptiz'd Infants. Some frivolous forms of the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> conſtrain'd the Fathers to Rebaptize. The Cuſtom of Annual Bathing not effectual for Baptiſm. The abuſe of it. The State of Eccleſiastical Affairs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in <hi>Habeſſinia.</hi> The Reaſons. General Confeſſion. Abſolution. Before <hi>25</hi> years of Age they believe themſelves Innocent. Much Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s Opinion of their Sermons. They Read Homilies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sacred Veſſels for the Eucharist. Why the Stone Conſecrated by the <hi>Romans</hi> is call'd a <hi>Cheſt</hi> by the <hi>Habeſſinians.</hi> A particular Diſcourſe of the Author. Leavened Bread. The Wine diſtributed in a Spoon. The defect of it ſupply'd, The time and place for the Holy Supper. Two Holydaies in a Week. They want Bells. Their Muſic unpleaſing, yet they Daunce about. Faſtings, and fourth and ſixth Holydaies whence. None during <hi>Eaſter.</hi> Of the Faſts of the Proteſtants in <hi>Europe.</hi> The beginning of the year. Their manner of Computation, Nuptial Rites. Polygamy. Marriages of Couſin Germans, or firſt Couſins. Divorces. Burials.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HItherto we have ſet forth what the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> believe concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> &amp; the Principal Articles of the Chriſtian Faith. The order of our Story now requires that we ſhould ſay ſomething of their Rites and Ceremonies. For tho it nothing avail at what time or in what manner ſound Doctrine be Preach'd, ſo that all things be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order; nevertheleſs theſe Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have begat great Diſputes, and produc'd great Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in the Church.</p>
                  <p>For indeed from the very Infancy of the Goſpel, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous were the Contentions of Holy and Pious men about Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Some believ'd that the <hi>Judaic</hi> Rites, not being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly abrogated by Chriſt, were of neceſſity to be obſerv'd, together with the Doctrine and Sacraments of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59633:131"/>
even as helps to Salvation. Others there were who judg'd that they might be profitably retain'd, though not of abſolute neceſſity, as well in remembrance of the ancient Church of God, as to gain the Souls of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The firſt Opinion the Apoſtles themſelves Condemn'd. In other things uſing Apoſtolic Prudence and Moderation, they made a diſtinction betwen <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ethnics</hi> newly Converted. For they not only permitted the <hi>Jews</hi> to retain their ancient Rites, but perſwaded <hi>Paul</hi> to comply with ſo many Millions of unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> who were Zealous Admirers of the Law, and accus'd <hi>Paul,</hi> for teaching a Defection from the Law, for forbidding Infants to be Circumciz'd, and for not living according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtoms. <hi>Paul</hi> obey'd, and purify'd himſelf with his Companions, ſhav'd his Head, and ſo entring the Temple together, offer'd up an Offering for every one of them. Nay, more then this, what would be now accompted a heinous Crime, he caus'd <hi>Timothy</hi> to be Circumciz'd, being induc'd thereto by the Neceſſity of thoſe times. Yet at another time he condemn'd Circumciſion, if it were done with a <hi>Judaic</hi> Intention.</p>
                  <p>Thus an Action in it ſelf indifferent, becomes bad or good, from the Reaſon and Intention of the Agent. But then, what what was to be done with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that embrac'd the Faith of Chriſt, the Apoſtles took into their Deliberation. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they would not oblige them to the Obſervation of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law, but only in anſwer to their Doubts, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them only to abſtain from thoſe things, which might not only create in the <hi>Jews</hi> a diſlike of the Goſpel; but alſo very much ſcandalize thoſe that were already Proſelytes, and diſturb mutual Charity and Friendſhip in daily Converſe and Society. For the <hi>Jews</hi> would not Dyet with thoſe who eat things <hi>Sacrific'd to Idols,</hi> or <hi>ſtrangled,</hi> nor the <hi>blood</hi> it ſelf. From that time ſome of the <hi>Judaic</hi> Rites prevail'd as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among moſt, who did not contend againſt Piety and Chriſtian Doctrine. Till at length by degrees they were either abrogated by the Church, or worn out of Uſe. Nor had the moſt ancient Inſtitutions of the Chriſtians any other Originals, as the <hi>Building of Churches, Plunging the whole Body in Baptiſm,</hi> Two <hi>Faſt Dayes</hi> in a Week, Feſtivals and the like. However there were but few Ceremonies in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome times of the Church; but in the times of Peace, they increas'd to Infinity: and the worſe the ſtate of the Church
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59633:131"/>
was, the more Ceremonies; inſomuch that St. <hi>Austin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in his time, <hi>That the moſt wholſom Precepts of Divine Books were not ſo much regarded, as the fictitious Comments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Men upon them.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by how much more opulent and powerful than the reſt; ſo much the more ſedulouſly and induſtriouſly it compos'd all things to Splendour and Pomp. The <hi>Roman</hi> Pontiff being the ſole Judge of all things, whether convenient, or not commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and what he thought fit to Abrogate or Eſtabliſh. But the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> obey as their High Pontiff, what with the unhappy Contentions between the <hi>Melchites,</hi> and <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and the Perſecutions of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,</hi> has had enough to do to keep his own Station, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at leiſure in the midſt of ſo many Storms, to think of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging new Ceremonies. Nor would the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> out of their wonted ſimplicity and plain heartedneſs, the beſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of ancient Cuſtom, attempt to alter or abrogate any thing without his leave or Command. Whence it comes to paſs, that many of the moſt ancient Cuſtoms of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, in other places out of date or abrogated, are ſtill retain'd to this day among them. Which makes us hope that our Labour will not be ungrateful to the Reader, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of Eccleſiaſtic Antiquity, if we compare the Old with the New. Firſt, only their Churches are briefly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, which formerly were ſufficiently Magnificent, and by King <hi>Ladibela</hi> hewn out of the Bodies of the Rocks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Some were alſo Built by the Succeeding Kings; but <hi>Grainus,</hi> out of his hatred to Chriſtianity, ruin'd the greateſt part of them. There are yet remaining ſome Footſteps of that famous Cathedral, which <hi>Helena, David</hi>'s Grandmother Built: In which there is more want of Light than of Gold or Silver. The Structure of moſt reſembles the Ancient Architecture. For the ancient Chriſtians, when firſt they had obtain'd the Opportunities of building Churches for Public Uſe, chooſing rather to imitate the <hi>Jews,</hi> than the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Built them in imitation of the ancient Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues; nor did they give them the heatheniſh Names of Temples; but call'd them <hi>Ilyriacas,</hi> as it were dedicated to God, or elſe <hi>Oratories,</hi> or <hi>Martyria,</hi> Places of Public Teſtimony. Now as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being encompaſſed with a ſpacious Wall, conſiſted chiefly of three parts; that is to ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59633:132"/>
                     <hi>wide Porch,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>the body of the Temple;</hi> and laſtly, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> ſo the Cathedrals of the Ancients, had a Porch before the great Folding Dores ſurrounded with a Wall, where the <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> and <hi>Penitents,</hi> and <hi>Novices</hi> were oblig'd to tarry, till the latter more fully inſtructed in Chriſtianity, were admitted to Baptiſm; or the former brought forth the real fruits of Amendment. Then there was the Body of the Church, in the middle of which was a <hi>ſecret Place,</hi> ſcreen'd with a Curtain, which was call'd the <hi>Sacrificatory,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Suggeſtum,</hi> or place where the Pulpit ſtood, in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which repreſented the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi> Such a <hi>Suggeſtum,</hi> or Place of Aſcenſion is ſtill to be ſeen in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues, and call'd in imitation of the Greek word <hi>Bimah.</hi> But this the <hi>Europeans</hi> afterward thought more convenient to remove to the farther end of the Church: we call it now the <hi>Quire,</hi> for the moſt part ſeparated with Iron Lattices from the Body of the Structure. Theſe Antique Forms of Building were accommodated to the ancient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. For as the <hi>Jews</hi> were admitted no farther than the Dores, and the Prieſts only ſuffer'd to paſs beyond the Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, ſo here none but the Baptiz'd were admitted as it were into the Boſom of the Church, the reſt, like the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> prohibited from approaching nearer than the Dores. The Quire none but the Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons enter'd, which was ſo rigidly obſerv'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> commanded the Emperor himſelf <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to withdraw; whereas the Greek Church allow'd that Priviledge to their Emperors, and gave them Liberty to enter the Sanctuary when they offer'd to the Sacred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. After the ſame manner, the more famous Churches of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were Built; and they have alſo the ſame ſort of Sanctuaries, which they call by the Hebrew Name, <hi>Heichel,</hi> at the entry whereof the Layety ſtand and receive the Communion. Leaſt therefore their Nobility and their Children ſhould be forc'd to ſtand among the Vulgar Croud, or they be conſtrain'd to break their Law and Cuſtom, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Layety to enter their <hi>Heichel,</hi> and participate of their Sacred Myſteries, they have found out a new Evaſion, by Creating the Nobility and their Children, tho' ne're ſo young, or under Age, <hi>Deacons</hi> or <hi>Sub-deacons;</hi> in that only deviating from their ancient Simplicity. The King's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren aſſume that Dignity of courſe, carrying a Croſs, as a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59633:132"/>
badge of their <hi>Deaconſhip,</hi> which they ne'r leave off when they come to the Crown. Which the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> looking upon as an Ornament of <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> it gave them an occaſion to give the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Emperor the Title of <hi>Presbyter John.</hi> There is alſo a little Chappel adjoyning to the Eaſtern part of the Church, in which the Bread and other Neceſſaries belonging to the Euchariſt are prepar'd. Such little Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels or Rooms were Built of old near to the great Church, where the Biſhops were wont to put on their Veſtments: now they are ſmall Apartments made within the Walls of the Church, call'd by the Name of Veſtries. They have no Seats in their Churches, for they neither ſit nor kneel, but always ſtand during Divine Service; according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ruſſes</hi> obſerve to this day, as believing it more becoming the Reverence due to the Place, and more proper for Attention than to ſit. The next Age providing more kindly for Infirmity, permitted ſitting, leaſt Attention ſhould be tyr'd by wearineſs. But the <hi>Habeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines</hi> have found out a way between both; that is to ſay, little Crutches to lean and reſt their Bodies, which when they go away, they leave in the Church Porch. If there be any who out of weakneſs chance to ſit upon the Ground, they are in the mid'ſt of Prayers commanded by the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to riſe, in theſe words, <hi>Eb Tarber, Tanſe,</hi> You <hi>that ſit, Riſe.</hi> Nay, ſuch is their Reverence to their Churches, that tho at this day they are only poor low dark Buildings, thatch'd with Straw or Reeds, yet when they approach near to any of them in their Travels, they alight from their Mules, and walk a foot till they are paſt them: They alſo put off their Shooes at the Door, and never ſpit upon the Pavement. No Females are admitted during their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, nor Wives that have known their Husbands, all the day following. In this none more Rigid then the Ancients, who only admoniſh'd ſuch to Abſtain from the Holy Communion.</p>
                  <p>Pictures they admit into their Churches; but as for Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Sculptures Engraven or Caſt, they abominate them, with the ſame antipathy as they do Idols. Perhaps becauſe they never had any in the Primitive times of the Church. For it was the Saying of the Ancients, <hi>Why ſhould Men go about to make any likeneſs of God, when Man himſelf was his Image, and no better could be made?</hi> And therefore it is a hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59633:133"/>
Offence for any one to carry about them the Picture of Chriſt Crucify'd. However the Clergy carry bare Croſſes in their hands, which they who meet them, reverence with a Kiſs; thereby Profeſſing themſelves Chriſtians. For they often ſign both themſelves, and the things that belong to them, with the Sign of the Croſs, after the Cuſtom of the moſt ancient Chriſtians; who were wont ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall now proceed to the Sacred Ceremonies of the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> beginning with the firſt initiation into Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> The Prieſt being to Baptize a Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of full Age, which there many times happens, by reaſon of the frequent Converſion of the Heathen, begins with the 52 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> then having Perfum'd the Perſons with a Cenſor of Frankincenſe, he enquires the Names of them that are to be Baptiz'd. Then after the Recital of certain Prayers, the Deacon at the ſame time frequently Exhorting the Hearers to joyn with the Prieſt, he Anoints ſeveral parts of the Body with the Holy Oyl, and lays his Hand upon the <hi>Neophyte's</hi> Head. Which done, the <hi>Neophytes,</hi> lifting up their right Hands, and looking toward the Weſt, abjure <hi>Satan,</hi> as the Prince of Darkneſs. Then turning to the Eaſt, as to the Sun of Juſtice, and lifting up again their Right hands, they make as it were a kind of Vow to Chriſt; which don, they ſay over the Creed after the Prieſt, who putting the Queſtion, They anſwer, <hi>They do Believe.</hi> Which ended, the Parties again are anointed, and ſome certain pieces of Chapters are read out of the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> the Acts of the Apoſtles, and the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> At length the Oyl is ſo pour'd into the Water prepar'd for the Baptiſm, as to reſemble in falling the Signature of the Croſs, and after the Rehearſal of ſeveral other Prayers, the Prieſt deſcends into a certain Pool, made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe before the Doors of the Church, whither the Perſons being conducted by the Deacon, the Prieſt takes them, and plunges them three times over Head and Ears, ſaying, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> At the ſame time the Men have Men, the Women Women to aſſiſt them, who lending their Hands and Arms to their Friends, ſupport them in going out of the Pool, and were therefore call'd <hi>Suſceptores</hi> or <hi>Upholders</hi> by the Ancients. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus waſh'd, and once more anointed, they are firſt
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59633:133"/>
clad with a White Under-garment, to ſignifie the Purity of the Mind; and over that, with a Red Veſtment, in token of their Salvation purchas'd by the Blood of Chriſt; and ſo introduc'd into the Church, where, being intermixed with Chriſtians, they are made Partakers of the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. At their departure they are preſented with Milk and Honey, and ſo the Prieſt laying his Hand upon their Heads, diſmiſſes them with this Benediction, <hi>Sons of Baptiſm, go in Peace.</hi> For the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> frequently call the Chriſtians <hi>Velda Temqet, Sons of Baptiſm.</hi> All which Circumſtances are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rites of the Ancients. <hi>Let us thrice be plung'd,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian, and thence ſupported, let us taſt the Society of Milk and Honey.</hi> Theſe are the Ceremonies obſerv'd toward thoſe of ripe years.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies of Baptizing Infants are much ſhorter. Males were formerly never Baptiz'd before the Fortieth day, Females before the Eightieth day, unleſs upon imminent danger of Death. But now they haſten Baptiſm much ſooner, eſpecially if the Infant be weak and ſickly. The Godfathers and Godmothers make anſwer to the Prieſt in their behalf. Nor are they plung'd in the Water, but only Sprinkl'd and Dipp'd, and that at the Entrance only of the Church; there being no admittance for them into the Church before Baptiſm. Laſtly, Becauſe the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is given to thoſe of riper years preſently after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, therefore leaſt Infants ſhould be in a worſe Condition, in former times they dropt two or three drops out of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Cup, having crumbl'd a little piece of the Holy Bread into it before: to ſhew there was the ſame regard to be had to them, as to thoſe of riper Age. Which being long obſerv'd in the Latin Church, the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> together with the <hi>Armenians,</hi> obſerve the Cuſtom to this day. <hi>Gregory</hi> told me, That they did no more than only dip the top of one of their Fingers in the Wine, and moiſten the Childs tongue. Now that they uſe the ſame form of words with us, <hi>Alvarez</hi> is Poſitive, that is to ſay, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Nor could I apprehend any otherwiſe out of their own Liturgies.</p>
                  <p>Which makes it more to be admir'd, what the Fathers of the Society, making no mention at all of this Form, have written into <hi>Europe,</hi> That ſeveral partly unwonted, partly frivolous Forms, and quite altering the Eſſence of Baptiſm,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59633:134"/>
were made uſe of by the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Clergy: For Example, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the moſt Holy Trinity; I Baptize thee in the Name of Chriſt; I Baptize thee in the Name of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> only; <hi>I Baptize thee in the Water of</hi> Jordan; <hi>The Lord baptize thee; Let God waſh thee; Let Baptiſm waſh thee; Bleſſed be the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others of the ſame Nature. For which reaſon they were conſtrain'd to Rebaptize many People, not permitted by the Catholic Church, but upon extraordinary occaſions. So that at length they promiſcuouſly Rebaptiz'd all the <hi>Habeſsinians,</hi> tho with this Condition, That the firſt Baptiſm was not rightly perform'd, which drew upon them the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Envy of the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Clergy.</p>
                  <p>Many Writers have believ'd, and reported, That the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians</hi> were branded with a Mark after Baptiſm, in order to the fulfilling the words of <hi>St. John, He that cometh after me ſhall Baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi> But <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf deny'd any ſuch Cuſtom, nor do the Fathers of the Society make any mention of it in their Writings. But this is certain, that the People of <hi>Africa,</hi> as well <hi>Gentils,</hi> as <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> do cauterize the Temple-Veins of Children newly Born, to preſerve them from <hi>Catarrhs.</hi> Which being perhaps done by ſome of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> to the ſame end, was by ſome ignorant Foreigners taken for a Religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. As having heard that formerly there were a ſort of ſilly Heretics, who miſinterpreting the word <hi>Fire,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo taken, and wreſting it to the Improper ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſm, preferr'd the Cauſtic Signature of Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ceremony of waſhing in Water.</p>
                  <p>But now for what concerns their <hi>Anniverſary</hi> Baptiſm, with which the <hi>Abeſsines</hi> are ſo much reproach'd, we are to give this Light. Upon the XI. of <hi>January,</hi> which with us is upon the Sixth, in the mid'ſt of their Summer, and the Feaſt of the Epiphany, they keep a moſt joyful Feſtival in Commemoration of the Baptiſm of our Saviour, which with many of the Ancients, they certainly believe, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd upon that day. By the firſt Dawn of the Morning Light, the Clergy begin the Solemnity with certain loud and chearful Hymns. The King with all the Nobility of the Court, the Metropolitan with the Clergy, Nobles and Plebeians, Old and Young, before Sun-riſe, throng into the Rivers and Ponds, and there delight themſelves in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59633:134"/>
plunging and diving over Head and Ears. As they meet any of the Prieſts, they crave a Bleſſing from them, who return them generally their deſires in theſe words, <hi>God bleſs thee;</hi> or, <hi>God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt bleſs thee.</hi> Hence it was that many believ'd that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> renew'd their Baptiſm every year. But as exceſs of Joy fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently begets wantonneſs; ſo is it frequent for the Young men upon this day to leap, and dance, and ſwim and duck one another; and by and by to fill the neighbouring Fields with Hoopings and Hallowings, the uſual Conſequences of ſuch kind of Sports. So that they make of it rather a day of Jollity, than a Pious Chriſtian Feſtival. All this I relate from <hi>Gregorie</hi>'s own Lips. The Relation of <hi>Alvarez</hi> is quite different, as if it were a real Baptiſm, and that the Men and Women were at that time promiſcuouſly rebaptiz'd. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did ſo, or whether <hi>Alvarez</hi> rightly underſtood the words of the Baptizer, I very much queſtion. And yet I cannot but very much wonder at what <hi>Tellez</hi> reports, That at other times, and for ſlight cauſes, both Men and Women cauſe themſelves to be rebaptized, and that after a moſt indecent manner. For ſhould ſuch a thing have been cuſtomary, King <hi>Baſilides</hi> would never have upbraided the Fathers with their reiteration of Baptiſm, ſo frequently as he did. For my part, I never read or heard of any ſuch thing. However, if any ſuch thing were ever practis'd, it is to be attributed rather to the ſtupid ignorance of the Prieſts, then to allow'd Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>For in the laſt Century ſuch was the moſt miſerable Condition of the Eccleſiaſtical Affairs in <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> that nothing could be more deplorable: at what time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the continual Invaſions and Irruptions of the <hi>Gallans</hi> and <hi>Adelans,</hi> the People were diſpierc'd and ſcatter'd up and down the Mountains and Rocks, like a Flock without a Shepheard, without Law, and almoſt without either King or Metropolitan; all Sacred Worſhip ceas'd; their Clergy were diſſipated, and their Temples and Monaſteries every where ruin'd and burnt. What wonder then that <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Sloth</hi> ſhould grow upon them? and that the illiterate Prieſts, for want of Books, not to be ſupply'd by Printing, and through the ſcarcity of Learned Men, ſhould raſhly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude many things altogether Foreign from the Rites of their Anceſtors. For ſuch Accidents frequently happen in great
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59633:135"/>
Calamities, when Biſhops and Princes cannot perform, or elſe grow careleſs of their Offices; when little regarding their own Eternal Salvation, they leave that to fate, or the pleaſure of every private Perſon, which ſhould be their chief and principal care. Such was the Sluggiſhneſs that overwhelm'd all <hi>Greece,</hi> in the time of <hi>Maurice</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; ſo that neither <hi>Gregory</hi> underſtood Greek, nor any one at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> could underſtand Latin, ſuch was the miſery of that Age, in the Latin Church, as <hi>Baronius</hi> teſtifies, when nothing but meer Barbariſm and Ignorance Triumph'd, when all Arts and Vertuous Studies were Exil'd, and only Vice prevail'd in Church and State. At that time there was a certain Prieſt, who neither like a Latiniſt, nor a Chriſtian, had Baptiz'd ſeveral Infants in <hi>Nomine Patria, &amp; Filia, &amp; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sancta,</hi> which Baptiſm was however confirm'd by <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> the Pope, by reaſon of the good intention of the <hi>Baptizer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Sinners after Baptiſm are reconcil'd to God and the Church, they make no Queſtion: However they teach that there muſt be a Repentance for theſe Sins, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to be made known by Confeſſion. But to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all and ſingular their particular Sins, with all their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they think it neither commanded of God, nor at all neceſſary. And therefore, they only ſay in general words to the Prieſt, <hi>Abſan, Abſan, we have Sinn'd, we have Sinn'd.</hi> So that when the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts preſs'd them to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Confeſſion, they never acknowledg'd any more than three, if they had been guilty, <hi>Homicide, Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Theft.</hi> To confeſs any more they could not be induc'd without great difficulty. The Offender is Abſolv'd in very few words, together with ſome gentle ſtripes upon the Side with an Olive twigg, which is thought ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from the Power of <hi>Satan.</hi> But as for them that have committed any of thoſe great Crimes before-named, they are not only chaſtiz'd with ſevere Reprehenſion and bitter Language, but many times alſo ſeverely Scourg'd, to the end they may not only hear, but be ſenſible of their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. <hi>Tellez</hi> reports, That the Metropolitan ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hears Confeſſions himſelf; and that when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the heinouſneſs of the Crime, he riſes up, and after a ſharp rebuke of the Penitent, he cryes out, <hi>Haſt thou done this? Doſt thou not fear God? Go too, let him be Scourg'd
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59633:135"/>
thirty or forty times.</hi> Preſently the Executioners are ready, who ſtreight prepare their Scourges, and give the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinner ſix or ſeven cutting laſhes; the reſt being remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Interceſſion of the Standers by. There was one who to avoid ſo ſharp an Abſolution of his Crime, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of the Metropolitan ſitting in his Seat of Judicature, that he might make his Confeſſion in Private; to whom the Metropolitan, <hi>How! Shall not thy Sin be made manifeſt at the laſt day, before all the World?</hi> Tell therefore, <hi>what it is?</hi> The unfortunate Offender believing it his duty to obey, openly confeſs'd, it was the <hi>ſtealing of Oxen.</hi> By chance the Owner of the Oxen was there; who being glad that he had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Thief, preſently accus'd him, ſo that the poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low being Convicted of the Fact by his own Confeſſion before ſo many Witneſſes, was conſtrain'd to reſtore the Oxen, and undergo a ſevere Puniſhment beſide.</p>
                  <p>But as the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> are generally of a ſoft and mild Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for the moſt part, ſo ſoon as they have committed any notable Offence, they preſently run to their Confeſſors, and confeſſing they have ſinn'd, deſire to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for the quiet of their Conſciences. But this they do not do, till they come to be at leaſt Five and twenty years of Age. For till then they prolong their years of Indiſcretion, pretending Childiſh Innocence. So that if a Young man die before he be Twenty years old, they bewail him in theſe words, <hi>Oh! let my Soul be like the Soul of this Innocent.</hi> So great a Confidence they have in the honeſt Inclinations of their Youth.</p>
                  <p>The whole Divine Service of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> is compleated by the ſole Adminiſtration of the Sacrament, and reading ſome few broken parcels of Chapters out of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: for they neither make uſe of Sacred Hymns nor of Preaching. Which when we ſeem'd to wonder at, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> ask'd me, <hi>Whether we thought our Preachers could ſpeak any thing better then what was written in the Sacred Scripture, or the Homilies of the Fathers of the Primitive Church? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we thought their Sayings more efficacious than the Word of God? Whether we did not fear, leſt thoſe Preachers ſhould utter ſomething which might be repugnant to our Faith and Salvation, which might prove of dangerous Conſequence, eſpecially among the Plebeian and ruſtic ſort of People?</hi> We anſwer'd, That the Worſhip of God requir'd it; and that the uſe and end of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59633:136"/>
Preaching was at large ſet forth in Scripture; to the end we might underſtand the benefit of them. But the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> to ſupply this defect, have Compos'd ſeveral Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies and Homilies, of which mention has been already made. To theſe they add ſeveral Portions of Scripture uſually appointed to be read, which are fourfold, out of the Evangeliſts, the Acts, the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Canonical Epiſtles; to which they give the Titles of <hi>Wengel,</hi> the <hi>Evangils, Gheber,</hi> the <hi>Acts, Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Hawarja</hi> the Apoſtle. But in the general Liturgy, which they call <hi>Canon Kedaſi,</hi> the <hi>Canon of the Maſs,</hi> there are all their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be found, with all their Prayers accuſtom'd to be apply'd to the ſeveral Varieties of Duties to be perform'd; all their Inſtruments and Veſſels being ſanctify'd by certain Prayers and Ejaculations. For in the Sanctuary ſtands the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> which they call <hi>Kedeſat Terphez,</hi> vulgarly <hi>Manbar.</hi> It differs from their Common Tables, for that you may go round about it, and place what you pleaſe upon it. Only it is cover'd with a Canopy, ſuſtain'd with four Pillars at each Corner. Upon this they place the Sacred Veſſels. Firſt the <hi>Tabot,</hi> or <hi>Chest:</hi> A little Table ſo call'd; but the reaſon why, I never yet could find; for that it has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a Cheſt; it being an Oblong Quadrangular Table, upon which the Diſh and the Cup are ſet; and therefore I muſt repair to conjecture, which I ſhall willingly ſubmit to the Judgment of the Learned.</p>
                  <p>The moſt ancient Chriſtians, when for almoſt three Ages together, they could not have the Opportunity of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring or receiving the Communion in Public, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to take their Opportunities in Dens and Caves; but for the moſt part in the Church-yards, in the ſilence of the Night. To which purpoſe, they either carry'd the Bread, Wine, Cup, and other Utenſils wrapp'd up in Linnen, or otherwiſe conceal'd to the place where the Congregation met. Whence it ſeems very probable to me, that they might make uſe of the Coffins themſelves, or ſome Cheſt in the faſhion of a Bier, to conveigh their Sacred Utenſils, under the pretence of carrying forth their Dead. Which Cheſt being thus conveigh'd into the Church-yard or Cave where they met, ſerv'd alſo inſtead of a Table, about which the Communicants ſate, and receiv'd in their Order. If they found any Bones of the Holy Martyrs ſcatter'd about,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59633:136"/>
they gather'd them up, and put them up in this Cheſt, which Cuſtom in after Ages became a Law. If they were driven from their Habitations, or conſtrain'd for fear of Tyrannical fury to ſeek new abodes, this Cheſt was ſtill carry'd from place to place, where the Biſhop or Presbyter reſided, who was to perform the Sacred Duty. And thus they came to be call'd either Cheſts by their proper Names, or Tables in reference to their Uſe, the Name of Altar growing out of Mind. For ſo <hi>Minutius Felix; D'ye think,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that we conceal the Deity whom we ſerve, becauſe we have not Temples and Altars,</hi> properly ſo call'd? Afterwards they began in reſpect of the Oblations to be call'd Altars. But in proceſs of Time, when the Sacrament came to be Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd without controul, there happen'd a great Change. For that ſome thought it not lawful to perform the Sacred Duty, otherwhere then at thoſe wooden Cheſts, which long Cuſtom had now made <hi>Religious.</hi> And therefore being brought forth of the Caves where they had been Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they were ſet apart for the Adminiſtration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; and it is not unlikely, that in regard they were to be plac'd upon low Tables, they were made the more plain, and the leſſer, that they might be more fit for uſe; till at length they came to be made like the Tables themſelves; ſo that now the form being chang'd, the name only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears among the <hi>Ethiopians.</hi> But after that, when Chriſtians began to rear great and ſtately Fabricks, thoſe Arks or Cheſts together with the Tables, were plac'd in the Sanctuary; and in moſt Churches the Name of <hi>Table</hi> remain'd; but in Latin Church the Name of <hi>Altar,</hi> as the more worthy and decent Appellation prevail'd.</p>
                  <p>But this was an eſtabliſh'd Cuſtom among the Ancients, That the Baſis upon which the Sacred Veſſels were to be ſet, ſhould be firſt conſecrated. Whence it came to paſs, that the <hi>Tables</hi> or <hi>Altars</hi> themſelves were conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo the uſe of thoſe Arks or Cheſts ceas'd. But where there were no Altars, or that the queſtion was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were conſecrated or no, there the Greeks had their <hi>Antimenſae,</hi> or little Crickets; the Latins, their <hi>Portalia</hi> or ſmall Portative Tables, which they ſet upon thoſe Altars that were not conſecrated. But for the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> they make uſe of their Cheſt and their Table both together; to the end the Service may be the more fully and abſolutely
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59633:137"/>
perform'd, and nothing left undon. Now in regard theſe Cheſts were formerly made of Wood, it was not material what ſort of Wood. But after the Popes had commanded that the Altars ſhould be made of <hi>Parget,</hi> the little Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Altar was alſo made of the ſame matter, for that reaſon call'd <hi>Lapis Sacratus,</hi> or the <hi>Conſecrated Stone.</hi> The little Cheſt which the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> uſe, is generally of Wood, though they do not Prohibit thoſe that are made of Stone, or caſt Metal. However the Fathers of the Society would not permit them to make uſe of any but of Stone; the reſt they either burnt or melted down.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover 'tis well known, that in the Infancy of the Catholic Church, the Altars were of Wood, like little Cheſts, and there were no other Altars of Stone, till the time that</hi> Silveſter <hi>began to Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Altars of kind. However he left remaining in the Cathedral of St.</hi> Peters, <hi>others ſay in St.</hi> John Laterano, <hi>a little wooden Cheſt, which for ſo many years had bin the Altar which ſo many Pious Popes had made uſe of, and upon which it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at this day for any Perſon but the Pope himſelf to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Studious Reader may perceive frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have bin made of theſe <hi>Cheſts;</hi> and if the <hi>little Cheſt</hi> of which <hi>Tellez</hi> has given us a Relation, be ſtill Extant at <hi>Rome,</hi> there can be no room left for any farther doubt concerning the Matter or the Form: and our Conjecture concerning their Original will ſtand good, till the Learned ſhall give us better Information. Now, that the <hi>Martyrs</hi> Bones were anciently put into theſe <hi>Cheſts,</hi> we gather from the <hi>Council of Carthage,</hi> which approves and confirms the Cuſtom. For ſo runs the 14 Canon of the <hi>Fifth</hi> by Name, but <hi>Third</hi> in Order of Time. The Altars, <hi>In which</hi> (he doth not ſay <hi>above,</hi> nor <hi>under) there are no Reliques of Martyrs, ſhall be remov'd.</hi> Neither could thoſe Bones be diſpos'd of in Tables, nor in the Altars, ſo call'd, of the Ancients. And in this we have bin the more prolix, to the end the Original and Uſe of the <hi>Ethiopic Chest,</hi> appropriated to the Communion, might be the better underſtood.</p>
                  <p>The other holy Veſſels are <hi>Pahal,</hi> the <hi>Diſh, Tzevae,</hi> the <hi>Cup,</hi> and Spoon for diſtribution of the Wine, call'd <hi>Eref Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,</hi> the <hi>Spoon of the Croſs;</hi> by reaſon that the handle ends in a little Croſs. Beſides theſe, they have their conſecrated <hi>Urns</hi> and <hi>Cenſors,</hi> in regard they frequently fume with Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, which Neceſſity conſtrain'd them to do while they were forc'd to make uſe of Caves and Subterraneal Places.</p>
                  <p>In the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament, they uſe a ſort of leaven'd Bread (as was done in the Latin Church for many
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59633:139"/>
Ages) Mark'd with a Croſs <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, imprinted into the Maſs of the Loaf. This Bread they call <hi>Korban,</hi> and Bake it new every day, admiring at the Latins for keeping their Holy Bread till the Morrow. But upon the Fifth Holy-day of the great Week, in Memory of Chriſt's unleaven'd Loaves, they alſo uſe unleaven'd Bread; pieces of which the Prieſt diſtributes to the Communicants. For they all participate of one Loaf. The Wine is by the <hi>Deacon</hi> given out of the Cup in a Spoon indifferently to all, as well Layety, as Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. True it is, they want real Wine; the defect of which they ſupply by ſteeping the bruis'd Stones of <hi>Raiſins</hi> in Water, and then ſqueezing and ſtraining the Infuſion, which makes a kind of <hi>Raiſin</hi> Liquor. Yet not believing it thus made to be ſmall enough, the <hi>Subdeacon</hi> pours a Spoonful or two of Water into the hollow of the Communicants hand, with which he firſt waſhes his mouth, and after that, ſups it up. <hi>Tellez</hi> will not allow this Liquor to be other then meer Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and for that reaſon laughs at the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they Communicate in both kinds, when they Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in neither; tho the Fathers of the Society, for want of Wine, were forc'd to uſe the ſame Liquor in the former Age. Which <hi>Sandovall</hi> calls a Holy and Provident In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Moſt certain it is that many Countreys, eſpecially inhabited by barbarous People, and remote from the Sea, are deſtitute of Wine; as the <hi>Copts</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Chriſtians of the Order of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>India.</hi> Nay, ſome there were, who were put to harder ſhifts than all this: having no other way but to dip a linnen Cloth in Wine, when they could come at it, and dry it again. This Cloath they kept very charily, and when they had an occaſion to Adminiſter the Sacrament, they moiſten'd a part of the Cloath in water, and wrung the moiſture out again with their hands. Which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo reliſh'd and tinctur'd, they gave to the People.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Shifts Pope <hi>Julius</hi> condemns, however in a caſe of Neceſſity, he permits the cluſter it ſelf to be ſqueez'd into the Cup, and the Liquor to be mix'd with water.</p>
                  <p>The time of receiving the Sacrament, is left to every man's liberty; ſome receive every Week, ſome every Month; but always within the Church. For they hold it a great Sin to carry the Holy Myſteries out of the Church into private Houſes: Neither does the King, nor the Metropolitan aſſume to themſelves that Priviledge. They never ſpit,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59633:139"/>
that day they have receiv'd. They alſo receive Faſting, and toward the Evening too, if it be a faſting day.</p>
                  <p>But now to Adminiſter the Sacrament in large and crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, and upon Solemn days, it requires four or five Men at leaſt. <hi>Bahen,</hi> the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> or <hi>Kaſis,</hi> the <hi>Presbyter. Nefek Kaſis,</hi> the <hi>Sub-Presbyter; Daj-kan,</hi> the <hi>Deacon;</hi> and <hi>Nefeh Dajkan,</hi> the <hi>Sub-Deacon.</hi> There are alſo preſent other Aſſiſtants, to hold the Candles, and to attend upon the Prieſts. Theſe every one taking his particular part, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the whole Duty, reading of ſeveral Prayers, as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Action, and the uſe of diſtinct Veſſels require. Laſtly, they recommend both the <hi>Living</hi> and the <hi>Dead</hi> to God, which they call <hi>receiving the Dapdukon,</hi> the <hi>Diptych,</hi> or <hi>Church Regiſter;</hi> which among the Ancient Greeks, conſiſted of two Tables, wherein the Name of thoſe were written, who were to be Pray'd for in the Regiſter. There are ſome that bring their Offerings to the Holy Table, as Bread, Oyl, Tithes, firſt Fruits, and the like; which at the Concluſion of the Sacrament, are diſtributed to the Poor. Which I take to be underſtood of that ancient Cuſtom mention'd by <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> in his <hi>Confeſsion of Faith. Vangaber Bat Meſah, that day,</hi> meaning the Sabbath, we make a Charitable Feaſt. Theſe Holydaies they keep two days every Week; that is to ſay, upon the Sabaoth and the Lord's-Day. That they call <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Ejehude,</hi> which they ſay they celebrate in commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the profeſſed Creation, and therefore they do not keep it ſo ſolemnly as the Lord's-Day. But upon the Lord's-Day, which they call <hi>Sanbat Ehad,</hi> or the Sabbath of the firſt Holyday; or <hi>Ehude,</hi> the <hi>firſt Holyday,</hi> ſingly, or <hi>Sanbat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtejan,</hi> the Chriſtians Sabbath, they keep after the cuſtom of the Catholic Church, and read over all the Offices and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices requir'd.</p>
                  <p>They have no Bells of Braſs, or mix'd Metal like ours; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which, they only uſe a kind of hollow Veſſels reſembling Bells, made of Iron, Stone, or Wood, more for Noiſe, than delightful to the Ear. Neither is their Church Muſic any thing more pleaſing. For beſides that, the Voices of their Singing Prieſts, whom they call <hi>Dabetra,</hi> are very harſh and ungrateful, the Inſtruments they make uſe of after the <hi>Egyptian</hi> manner, ſuch as Cimbals, Morrice Bells, and Kettle Drums, which the Grandees themſelves think no diſhonour to rattle upon thoſe Solemnities, are no
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59633:140"/>
way agreeable to the Harmony of <hi>Europe.</hi> With their Muſic they uſe Skipping and Dancing, in imitation of <hi>David</hi> Dancing before the Ark of the Covenant. At what time they make the Floor ring again after ſuch a rude manner, that you would believe them rather at a Wedding, than at a Chriſtian Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This they call <hi>exulting, rejoycing,</hi> and <hi>clapping hands to the God of</hi> Jacob, as they are commanded in the Pſalms; and this they call Praiſing God upon the Harp and Organ, and with <hi>Cymbals,</hi> tho it cannot be ſaid they are ſo ſweet ſounding as thoſe in <hi>David</hi>'s Time may be imagin'd to be. Which things tho they ſeem to us, not to correſpond with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Chriſtian Worſhip, yet will not they much admire, who well know, that in ſome places among the Latins, the Feaſt of the Body of God was ſolemniz'd with Dancing; which as it could not be done without Muſic, there were others that play'd in diſguiſe before the Dancers upon Harps.</p>
                  <p>Faſting days are no where more exactly obſerv'd. Not that they abſtain from ſome Meats, and gluttonize upon others. For that they look upon as a mockery of Faſting. For they keep themſelves whole dayes without either Food or Drink, even till Sunſet of the third Evening. Others there are that abſtain the two Holydaies of the Paſſion Week. The Monks put themſelves upon greater Extremities than all this; by which means they not only mortifie but deſtroy. Beſides all which they faſt twice in ſeven days, upon the Fourth and Sixth Holyday, like the reſt of the Eaſtern Churches. The reaſon of which was by <hi>Tzagazaab</hi> ſaid to be, for that the Fourth day the Murther of Chriſt was concluded upon, and the Sixth it was executed; according to what many of the Ancients taught. But we believe that theſe two Faſting-days, as many other things, were admitted and obſerv'd in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Primitive Chriſtians, who were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jews,</hi> or elſe had learn't from the <hi>Jews,</hi> that this Cuſtom was introduc'd and us'd as a Duty both Pious and Neceſſary for theſe times. For the <hi>Jews</hi> faſted twice in a Week; which is that which the Phariſee boaſted, <hi>I faſt twice upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> that is within the two days in ſeven, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Fifth Holyday; which the Chriſtians, becauſe they would not faſt upon the ſame day with the <hi>Jews,</hi> alter'd for the Fourth and Sixth. Afterwards <hi>Innocent,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, abrogating the Faſt of the Fourth Holyday, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59633:140"/>
Abſtinence from Fleſh upon <hi>Sunday,</hi> not minding the ancient Canon, <hi>If any Clergy-man ſhall be known to Faſt upon any Sabbath or Lord's-Day, one excepted, let him be ſuſpended from his Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That one Sabbath is <hi>Eaſter Eve.</hi> Otherwiſe to faſt upon the Lord's-Day, the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> account it Criminal, like the ancient Chriſtians; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> witneſſes. Beſides theſe, and other Faſts of the Eaſtern Church, they obſerve in the firſt place, the Forty days <hi>Lent,</hi> which they make up Fifty. For it begins Ten days before the Roman <hi>Lent;</hi> That is, upon the ſecond Holyday after <hi>Sexageſima Sunday.</hi> And this as a Command of God, they obſerve both healthy and ſick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, moſt exactly and religiouſly; only as we ſaid before, upon <hi>Sundays</hi> they eat Fleſh. After <hi>Eaſter,</hi> they ſupply the pinching hardſhip and ſobriety of the paſt Weeks with the Jollity and Mirth of thoſe that ſucceed. For during all the time of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> ſo formerly was the interval of the Fifty days call'd, (from the Feaſt of the Reſurrection till the Feaſt of tending the Holy Goſt) they ſpend their time in all manner of Feaſting and Jocundry, ſuitable to the Country. All that time, as of old with the Latins, ſo among the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians,</hi> being ſtill obſerv'd as one continu'd Feſtival. <hi>Gregory</hi> conſidering theſe things, and admiring that the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> obſerv'd no other Faſts, but what were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Princes in caſe of Public Calamity, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd out of St. <hi>Ambroſe; we do not Faſt becauſe the Lord abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with us, not only thoſe Fifty days, but all the year long, nay as long as we live.</hi> Thus Chriſt anſwer'd them, who objected to his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can the Sons of the Bridegroom mourn while the Bridegroom is among them. But the time ſhall come, that the Bridegroom ſhall be taken from them, and then they ſhall faſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the ancient Chriſtians, when thoſe days came that Chriſt had foretold, that is to ſay, the days of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Affliction, did well and truly in that they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſted. But we, in regard our Bridegroom is return'd with his favour and his Grace, and has reſtor'd Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity to his Church, have no need to obſerve ſet Faſts as neceſſary; but to ſay with St. <hi>Ambroſe, That true Fasting is an alienation from Incontinency of Language, Suppreſsion of wrath and ill Deſires, and Abſtinence from Slander and Reproach.</hi> And with St. <hi>Auſtin, The Great and General Faſting is to abſtain
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59633:141"/>
from Iniquity, and the unlawful Pleaſures of the Age, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Faſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides the Sabbath and Lord's-Day, they obſerve all the chief and ancient Feſtivals of the Catholic Church; The <hi>Annunciation, Nativity, Circumciſion, Baptiſm, Paſsion, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Aſcenſion,</hi> and the <hi>Deſcenſion</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, call'd <hi>Bagnab Arbgna,</hi> or the Feaſt of Forty days; as alſo that moſt ancient Feſtival of the Primitive Church call'd <hi>Rakeb,</hi> in the Middle of the Pentecoſt, by the Latins call'd <hi>Cantate,</hi> at what time the Biſhops are commanded to aſſemble a Synod, by the Canons commonly call'd <hi>Apostolical.</hi> As for the other Feſtivals, which were introduc'd by the <hi>Kopts, Greeks</hi> or <hi>Latins,</hi> after the Variances of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> ſome they admit, ſome they receive, according as they think moſt agreeable to their Religion.</p>
                  <p>They begin in the year from the Calends of <hi>September,</hi> with the <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Ruſsians,</hi> and other Oriental Chriſtians. For they believe that the World was created at the time of the Autumnal Equinoctial. They farther alſo compute Five thouſand and five hundred years to the <hi>Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Eight years leſs than the Greeks, and they who follow the Tranſlation of the <hi>Seventy Interpreters,</hi> from whence that Computation was made. The Supputation of the Chriſtians is the ſame, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſays was therefore don, becauſe the Chriſtians believe the World to be leſs ancient by Eight years then the Greeks do, but he does not apply his reaſon home. We are apt to believe it came to paſs through ſome erroneous Subſtraction of the years of the World. For that finding perhaps that the Greeks, to perfect the Calculation of the Years of Chriſt, had ſubſtracted 5508 years of the World; they alſo did the ſame, forgetting that thoſe Eight years were already wanting; or elſe having ſettl'd the years of Chriſt, according to the Greek Computation, and coming afterwards to reform the Age of the World, they found theſe Eight years to be over and above. However it fall out, let any one year of Chriſt be granted by them, Eight years muſt be added to their Computation, if you deſire to know the agreeing time of any certain Tranſaction.</p>
                  <p>Their year conſiſts of Twelve Months, as among us; But each Month, as among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> having but Thirty days; therefore to ſupply the <hi>Solar</hi> Year, to every Three years they add Five days, to every Four years Six days; which by
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59633:141"/>
a word borrow'd from the Greek they call <hi>Pagomen.</hi> Hence it happens, that their Feaſts go according to the <hi>Julian</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, and fall upon the ſame days; yet are otherwiſe number'd. For the Feaſt of the Nativity of Chriſt is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the ſame day with us, which happens among the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi> uſing the <hi>Julian</hi> Accompt, to be upon the 25 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> but with them falls upon the 28 of <hi>December.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Catholic Church in any part of the World ever obſerve it upon any other days; So that it is to be admir'd that <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſhould go about to Tranſlate it into Autumn. It is farther obſervable, that to the ſpace of Four years they give the Denomination of one of the Evangeliſts; it being the Cuſtom to finiſh the reading of one Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt quite through in that time. Which is the reaſon that in ſome of their Chronological Computations, you ſhall find added, <hi>in the days of</hi> Mark, <hi>in the days of</hi> John <hi>the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns their Nuptial Rites, moſt certain it is, that <hi>Polygamy</hi> is not allow'd by the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Church, however it be tolerated by the Civil Magiſtrate. For they that Marry more than one are not puniſh'd by the Magiſtrates; yet they are prohibited from the Holy Sacrament: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe ſort of People, that do no injury to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, but only contradict the Rules of Chriſtian Sanctity; as if it were not the Office or Duty of Kings and Princes, but of the Biſhops of the Church to make Men God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Chriſtianly vertuous. This <hi>Alvarez</hi> aſſerts upon his own Knowledge: Whoſe Hoſt at <hi>Dobarra</hi> had Three Wives which had brought him Seven and thirty Children; for which there was no other notice taken of him, but only that he was not admitted to the Church, or to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, until he at laſt put Two of them away. Here it may not be improper to inquire how the Metropolitan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves himſelf toward their Kings, who have more Wives than one. For the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Kings, by vertue of an old Ill cuſtom, beſides ſeveral Wives lawfully Marry'd, are not aſham'd to keep ſeveral Concubines; as if they did it in imitation of <hi>Solomon,</hi> from whom they boaſt their Deſcent. True it is, That the Fathers of the Society would not grant Abſolution to <hi>Suſneus,</hi> before he had diſmiſs'd all his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary Wives, retaining only the firſt. Indeed it is to me no ſmall wonder, that the Laws of the Church, and the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59633:142"/>
Kingdom ſhould no better agree; that the one ſhould be ſo looſe in point of Marriages, the other ſo ſtrict; eſpecially where the diſpute ariſes, not ſo much as to the Matter, as to the Name. Thus we find the Marriages of Kindred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, even to diſtant degrees; for that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms of diſtinction, call one another all by the Names of Brothers and Siſters. Thus a Church-man may not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Brother's Wife, but a Lay Perſon may. However no Marriages but thoſe that are approv'd by Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are honour'd with Sacerdotal Benediction; nor thoſe neither publickly in the Church, unleſs they be ſuch Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to whom the <hi>Hallelujah</hi> is Sung. Other People are Marry'd either at home, or before the Dores of the Church. However all Secular Perſons have alſo this Priviledge, that they can throw off the Yoke when they pleaſe. For upon any ſlight Difference between a Man and his Wife, if they cannot be reconcil'd, the King's Judges preſently diſſolve the Marriage. But as for the Clergy, if it be their deſire to put away their Wives, or to Marry another, the firſt being Deceas'd, they are oblig'd to renounce their Function. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it happens, that their Marriages are much more peaceful, and more durable.</p>
                  <p>To conclude with their Burials, the Dead Bodies being well waſh'd and ſum'd with Incenſe, they wrap them up in proper Garments. If the Party deceas'd be of Noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, he is lay'd upon the Bier, cover'd with a Bulls Hide; which done, the Clergy carry him to the Grave, laden with Croſſes, Cenſors, and Holy-water; and that with a pace ſo ſwift, that it is a difficult matter to follow them. The Body is for ſome time ſet down by the Grave, during the reading of a certain Paragraph out of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel; after which, the Body, being found and ſprinkl'd with Holy <hi>Water,</hi> is not let down, but thrown into the Sepulcher.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Claudius</hi> being deſirous to Solemnize the Exequies of <hi>Chriſtopher Gomez,</hi> upon the Anniverſary Day, that he had loſt his Life, for the Recovery of <hi>Abaſſia,</hi> ſummon'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Prieſts, Canons, Monks, and all the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poor People; and to the firſt, being about Six hundred, he gave a Royal Funeral Supper; to the laſt, being about Six thouſand, he diſtributed a large and noble Alms. They on the other ſide recited the whole Pſalter quite thorough, and made the Sky ring with innumerable <hi>Allelujahs,</hi> a Ceremony, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59633:142"/>
ſerves alike as well upon ſad, as joyful Occaſions. Thus when <hi>Marcus,</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Suſneus,</hi> was Buried, they ſounded forth,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Marcus</hi> is Dead, Hallelujah,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Marcus</hi> is Dead, Hallelujah.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this they repeated ſo often and ſo loud, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but newly then arriv'd in. <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> were aſtoniſh'd to hear ſuch an unwonted cry; not being able to tell, whether the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> rejoyc'd, or lamented. So ſtrangely are all Nations delighted with their own Cuſtoms.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Clergy enjoy no immunity. Their Head or <hi>Abuna</hi> created by the Metropolitan of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> His Place in Councils. The preſent State of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church deplorable. The Clergy ignorant, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Illiterate. The <hi>Habeſſine</hi> Metropolitans ordain the Clergy only. No Biſhops, nor Arch-Biſhops. The <hi>Icegue</hi> governs the Monks. They acknowledge but four Oecumenical Patriarchs. The Catalogue of Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans incertain. They do not reck'n theſe ſent by the Pope. After <hi>Mendez,</hi> one call'd the <hi>Cophtit.</hi> His Succeſſors. The Orders of Deacon, Presbyter, and Sub-Presbyter. The Clergy Marry, but not twice.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have already declar'd, That the Supream Power in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, is inveſted in the King. Therefore all Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, except only in very ſlight Matters, are all determin'd by the King's Judges. Neither do the <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Monks</hi> enjoy any ſort of Eccleſiaſtical Immunity, or Priviledge of Exemption. Nor does the Canon, <hi>Siquis ſuadente diabolo, hujus Sacrilegii reatum incurrerit, quod in Clericum vel Monachum violentas manus injecerit,</hi> &amp;c. help them at all, but that upon offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted they are puniſh'd, as Lay Perſons, by the Secular Judges: And many times they are ſenſible of the rough and violent hands of wicked Men, without any fear of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59633:143"/>
But as to what concerns the <hi>Law of Order,</hi> or the <hi>Dioceſan Law,</hi> thoſe things are left to the Clergy. Their Chief Head is call'd <hi>Papas,</hi> or <hi>Metropolitan.</hi> Tho the Title or Sirname of <hi>Abuna,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently given him. He by ancient Cuſtom, at the King's deſire, is Conſecrated to that Dignity by the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and ſent out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> For they do not think it fitting for the Patriarch to nominate any one out of their own Nation, tho never ſo skilful in their Language, Laws and Cuſtoms. It being provided by thoſe <hi>Nicene</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, extant in the Arabic Language, <hi>That the</hi> Ethiopians <hi>ſhall not Elect or Create a Patriarch, but that their chief Chief Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſhall be under the Jurisdiction of Him that reſides at</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria. And a little after, <hi>That if the Council be held in</hi> Greece, <hi>and the Prelate of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>be preſent, he ſhall have the ſeventh place, next the Prelate of</hi> Seleucia. For they are very obſtinate in maintaining their old Cuſtoms, tho it happen to be one of their greateſt Misfortunes. The State and Condition of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church, being quite different now from what it was formerly; that is to ſay, altogether miſerable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable. For both the Patriarch and his Clergy, are a poor ſort of contemptible and ruſtic People, and void of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Endowments. They are as it were the Servants and Slaves of the <hi>Turks,</hi> whoſe continual vexations ſo terrifie them from undertaking Eccleſiaſtical Employment, that many times they receive their Ordination by conſtraint, and with Tears in their Eyes; which requires nothing more from them than to read <hi>Arabic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Coptic,</hi> or ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language, as it was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the times of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Kings, and as <hi>Athanaſius Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> has given a view of it to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> is now almoſt buried in Oblivion. Their Churches are either all deſtroy'd, or very near to Ruin; the <hi>Turks</hi> not ſuffering them either to Rebuild or Repair. The Patriarch, if he can but only read and write, and underſtand the Scripture after an ordinary manner, is thought ſufficiently worthy of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s <hi>Chair.</hi> Hence it may be eaſily conjectur'd, what ſort of Perſons are ſent into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for the Government of ſo many Churches. In the time of the Fathers of the Society, there was ſent ſuch a ſad Tool into <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> to be the <hi>Abuna,</hi> that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for his Simplicity, he was forc'd to Grind Corn for his living. To whom another Succeeding, not much better
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59633:143"/>
gifted, gave occaſion to the Courtiers to jeſt, and cry, <hi>We have a Miller ſtill.</hi> Now as theſe Patriarchs know very little, ſo they do as little, only in ſet forms of Words, they ordain Under-Clercs, juſt as wiſe and learned as themſelves.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the Fathers of the Society, little regarded the Ordinations of the <hi>Abuna,</hi> but when any of the <hi>Abeſsine</hi> Prieſts came over to them, they ordain'd them again after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, not without the great reſentment and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>In none of their Kingdoms or Provinces have they any <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Arch-Biſhops.</hi> So that unleſs the <hi>Icegue,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of his Monks, had taken ſome care of the Church, all thought of Religion had fallen to the ground long e're this.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Abuna</hi> is by ſome, tho improperly call'd <hi>Patriarch,</hi> his truer Title being that of <hi>Bik Papas,</hi> or <hi>Bik Papaſte,</hi> Prince or Maſter of the Metropolitans; of whom they acknowledge only Four to be of equal Power and Dignity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Among theſe they reckon the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch to be the Firſt, and call him <hi>Bik Papaſte Zaromeja,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.</hi> For they have no higher Title to give to any one who may be thought Superior to a Patriarch.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Metropolitan of <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> was <hi>Frumentius,</hi> the Ethiopic Apoſtle. From him to <hi>Simeon,</hi> who dy'd with <hi>Elius</hi> in defence of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion, they reck'n in order Ninety five Metropolitans. We have not yet ſeen the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, but in the Ethiopic Regiſter, they are Number'd up in this Order.</p>

                  <p>Among the Eaſtern Churches, honeſt and lawful Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was in much more high eſteem, than faithleſs Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorſhip, obnoxious to perpetual concupiſcence. Wherefore the <hi>Grecians, Armenians, Ruſſians,</hi> but more eſpecially our <hi>Ethiopians</hi> not only permitted their Presbyters to Marry, but ſooneſt prefer the Husbands of Wives; inſomuch that the neareſt way to that Preferment is to Marry. For they take the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let him be the Husband of one Wife, for a Precept;</hi> yet underſtand it only ſo, as not to extend any farther, but to one ſingle Marriage. And therefore their Clergy never offer to covet repeated Wedlocks, which even by the Seculars were not approv'd in the Eaſtern Churches. The <hi>Novatians</hi> deteſted a ſecond Wedlock after Baptiſm, as equal to the Crime of Adultery. The Latin Fathers alſo gave it an Ignominious Character, reproaching it with the Scandalous Title of honeſt Adultery. But in after Ages, the Matter being more wiſely conſider'd, it was not thought material, whether the ſame Perſon Married one or more Wives, after Death had once made the Seperation, ſo that the Matrimony were lawful; ſince there appear'd no reaſon to the contrary. For which was alleadg'd the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous example of one Woman at <hi>Rome,</hi> that had ſurviv'd the Two and twentieth Wedlock. But the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> ſtill

The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention deplor'd.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church remain'd in Unity with it ſelf, and with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, till the <hi>Council of</hi> Chalcedon, by us call'd the <hi>Fourth Univerſal Council,</hi> which <hi>Marcian</hi> the Emperor Summon'd, to appeaſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Diſſentions that were riſen among the Biſhops and Divines, by reaſon of the Doctrine of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> This <hi>Eutyches,</hi> a Conſtantinopolitan Abbot aſſerted, <hi>That both the Natures of Chriſt, the Divine and Human, upon his Incarnation, immediately became one and the ſame; and that therefore there was but one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and one Will in Chriſt.</hi> For which reaſon, they that held this Opinion were call'd <hi>Monothelites.</hi> Thereupon it was Decreed in this Council, <hi>That Chriſt was of the ſame Subſtance with the Father, according to his Deity, but Sin excepted; of the ſame Subſtance, and like to us in all things, according to his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. One and the ſame in two Natures united, yet without mixture, mutation, diviſion or diſtance, both Natures acting that which was proper to it, by Communion with each other Dioſcurus</hi> alſo, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was condemn'd as a Heretic, &amp; Defender of <hi>Eutyches;</hi> and not only ſo, but being publickly whipp'd, he was ſent into Exile, and another put up in his room, who becauſe he follow'd the Emperors or the Royal Religion,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59633:145"/>
was therefore call'd a <hi>Melchite,</hi> or Royaliſts according to the <hi>Arabic</hi> word. The Contradicters of this Opinion were call'd <hi>Eutychians,</hi> afterwards <hi>Jacobites</hi> from one <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Syrian, who ſtoutly defended the Doctrine of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> Hence aroſe a moſt fierce and outragious Schiſm in the Church of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> defil'd with Blood and Slaughter, which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that not only the greateſt part of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church was rent and torn from the reſt of the Catholic Church; but that <hi>Egypt</hi> alſo, weaken'd with it's own civil Diſſentions, became a Prey to the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who taking advantage of the Diſcords of the Chriſtians among themſelves, overcame and ſubjugated the upholders of both Opinions: ſo that now there is little or nothing remaining of Chriſtianity in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thus our Eccleſiaſtical Writers.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> relate, that <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> his Succeſſors, and their Followers, heavily complain'd of the Injury done them: for that he never follow'd <hi>Eutyches,</hi> nor ever deny'd nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd the Divinity and Humanity really exiſting in Chriſt; only he would not acknowledge the word <hi>Nature</hi> to be common to the Divinity and Humanity of Chriſt: and that he only endeavour'd to prevent the Aſſerting of two Perſons in Chriſt, contrary to the Opinion of the Catholic Church, and the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> believing that abſurdity would follow, ſhould we admit two Wills and Natures in Chriſt. Laſtly, That the word <hi>Nature,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying ſomething Born or Created, did no way quadrate with Divinity, neither could two Wills in two Natures, united without Diviſion, Separation, or Diſtance be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the underſtanding of Man: That it was not to be thought that Human Nature exalted to a State of Glory, would deſire, act, or ſuffer, what is ſuffer'd, acted, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in the State of Mortality; or that Humanity in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Glory, ſhould deſire or be ſenſible of that which Divinity was not ſenſible of or deſir'd. Which Opinion of his being heard and underſtood, it ſeem'd an idle Queſtion, a meer brangling Diſpute, that little deſerv'd to be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo much Enmity among the Chriſtians; as being become rather a Quarrel to be decided by the Sword, and not by Argument. And therefore theſe things conſider'd, it was evident that <hi>Dioſcurus,</hi> was neither ſufficiently heard nor rightly underſtood, but in his abſence condemn'd as an obſtinate Heretick, rather out of Hatred and Envy then by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59633:146"/>
Law. Theſe and ſuch like things when I heard <hi>Gregory</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, I began to apply my mind more particularly to this Affair, as being willing to know whether he only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his own Thoughts, or according to the Opinions and Writings of his own Country Doctors.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place therefore I found it beyond all doubt, that the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> do reject the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> tho they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not what was done therein, as having never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd or thought worthy of their Tranſcription the <hi>Canons</hi> there made. Nevertheleſs they inveigh moſt bitterly againſt the Council, and the Fathers there aſſembled, and load them with moſt injurious reproaches, calling them <hi>Mahebar Abdan,</hi> a <hi>Convention of Fools,</hi> &amp; <hi>Qualqedanowe jau,</hi> reck'ning the <hi>Chalcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> among the worſt of Heretics and Malefactors. In the ſecond place, I obſerv'd them fix'd in this Error, as believing the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> went about to divide the Subſtance of Chriſt, and contrary to the preceding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to make two Perſons of one, which they alſo attribute to the Latins. For this reaſon they condemn Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and extol <hi>Dioſcurus</hi> to the Skies, as the Champion of the Orthodox Faith, as being the Perſon, that out of a juſt and zealous Indignation, tore <hi>Leo</hi>'s <hi>Diploma,</hi> as ſoon as it was deliver'd to him; and reck'n him among the Number of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, for ſuffering himſelf to be ſcourg'd, his Teeth ſtruck out, and his Beard pull'd off, for ſtanding to the Truth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Peace to <hi>Dioſcurus,</hi> that ſtill reproach'd</l>
                     <l>The vain Opinions that the <hi>Melkites</hi> broach'd,</l>
                     <l>United God dividing into Two:</l>
                     <l>Then to confirm his <hi>Own</hi> in what was true,</l>
                     <l>His broken Teeth and Beard torn from his Chin,</l>
                     <l>Sends round the World t' evince <hi>Chalcedon</hi>'s ſpleen.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>They alſo aſcertain themſelves of a great reward laid up for Him in Heaven, in recompence of his ſo rigid Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, I found that they expreſly condemn <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches</hi> as a Heretic, but on the other ſide applaud <hi>Timotheus,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (whom our Writers affirm to have bin condemn'd in the Sixth general Council) by whoſe Doctrine, the followers of <hi>Eutyches</hi> were convicted; for ſo the ſame Poet, tho otherwiſe a cruel Enemy of the <hi>Chalcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Fathers writes of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:59633:146"/>
                     <hi>They that believ'd the Heretical Doctrine of</hi> Eutyches, <hi>were burnt by the Flames of his Expreſsions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho <hi>Gregory</hi> being demanded what he knew concerning him, made anſwer,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there were in</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>aſwel they who believ'd that</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches <hi>had made a confuſion of the two Natures of Chriſt, as they who believ'd he had not done it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence it appears that <hi>Eutyches,</hi> not his Errors, is defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome of the <hi>Ethiopians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is apparent, That they acknowledge both <hi>Mabqot</hi> and <hi>Tesbet</hi> the Divinity and Humanity to be both Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractively and Conjunctively in Chriſt. Which is as much as to allow two Natures together in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Tellez</hi> atteſts from the Relation of the Fathers of the Society, that both Natures are to be found in their Books, and imputes it to their Contumacy, that they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in words what they believe concerning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Truth, when they teach the ſame thing in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>That the Catholic</hi> Habeſſines <hi>ſuffering Perſecution from the Hereticks, cry'd out,</hi> God and Man, <hi>whereby they both aſſerted the Catholic Faith, and the two Natures in Christ.</hi> But more then this, we have the Teſtimony of <hi>Suſneus,</hi> in one of whoſe Orations to his Soldiers, we find that all the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>That Chriſt is the true God, and true Man;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt allow what the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Society relate, that they acknowledge two Natures in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, we are to take notice, That the words which the Greeks uſe, and which the Latines have made uſe of in theſe difficult queſtions of Faith, as <hi>Eſſence, Subſtance</hi> or <hi>Subſiſtance, Perſon, Nature,</hi> among the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> are interpreted by words Equivocal, from whence it is no wonder there ſhould be ſuch a ſpring of Errors. For <hi>Helave,</hi> ſometimes ſignifies <hi>Eſſence,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>Subſtance. Gregory</hi> alſo affirm'd, That there were ſome who aſſert <hi>Qalet Helwejet,</hi> two Eſſences, that is the Divinity and Humanity in Chriſt, and that each Nature retains its proper Eſſence. Others for fear of falling into the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Error, rather choſe to make uſe of the word <hi>Bakreye,</hi> which properly ſignifies a <hi>Pearl,</hi> affirming there are in Chriſt <hi>Qalit Bah reyat,</hi> two precious Subſtances; in imitation of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who uſe their own word, which ſignifies a <hi>Pearl,</hi> by which to expreſs the Divine <hi>Subſiſtance.</hi> Which others again diſlike, as being a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59633:147"/>
word no leſs Equivocal, becauſe it may be taken either for <hi>Subſiſtance</hi> or <hi>Perſon;</hi> as when they of the Son, <hi>Zatwalda em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baha reju Baab, who was born of the Subſtance of the Father.</hi> Thus the Author of a certain Manuſcript call'd, <hi>The Eccleſiaſtical Computation</hi> concludes,
<q>Who were witneſs of one Perſon of Christ, <hi>Synodius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence we gather, that when we from the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> diſpute of the <hi>Nature,</hi> they mean the <hi>Perſon.</hi> Now adays, when they ſpeak of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> they make uſe for the moſt part of the word <hi>Agal,</hi> as being leſs Equivocal; tho ſometime we ſhall meet with the word <hi>Gaz</hi> to ſignifie <hi>Perſon,</hi> ill render'd when taken for the <hi>Countenance</hi> or <hi>Face.</hi> Which Circumſtances, when I read and conſider, I find all things to be perplex'd and obſcure; no certain State of the Queſtion; and the words themſelves without limitation Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal. Perhaps <hi>Eutyches</hi> himſelf could not explain what ſort of <hi>Nature</hi> was meant, how it was made out of the <hi>two?</hi> How it was call'd? or what the Qualities of it were? But that he was ſo egregiouſly ſtupid, as to think the two Natures ſo mix'd in Chriſt, as <hi>Water with Wine,</hi> and that he had ſo many Wiſe and Learned Men to follow him in that Opinion, is almoſt incredible. As for the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> they are moſt certainly not guilty of ſo ſottiſh a Hereſie. For which reaſon I confeſs, I cannot apprehend what theſe frequent Diſputations were, which the Fathers of the Society had with the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> wherein, they ſay, the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were always forc'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as being convicted out of their own Books. Which is the more eaſie to believ'd, in regard they ſo willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Divinity and Humanity of Chriſt. But that they ſhould out of Contumacy and Heretical Pravity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Fathers, and chooſe to ſuffer Exilements, and other Puniſhments, or run the hazard of Civil Diſſentions, rather than forego their Opinion, is hardly to be credited. To me it ſeems therefore more probable, that they could not agree about the words. For if a man ſhould firſt explain his meaning, and tell them, that by the two Natures in Chriſt, we underſtand as well his Divinity as his Humanity, and then upon this Explanation ask them, <hi>Which Nature was wanting in Chriſt, ſeeing they acknowledge but one?</hi> Certainly
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59633:147"/>
they would anſwer, <hi>That neither his Divinity nor his Humanity were wanting; but that both continue and endure for ever.</hi> And thus it will appear, that they underſtand the word <hi>Nature</hi> far otherwiſe than we do, and that the true ſtate of the Queſtion among the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> conſiſts in this, <hi>Whether by any, or by what name both the Abſtract Natures</hi> (which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly they admit) <hi>are to be call'd?</hi> Now therefore becauſe <hi>Tellez</hi> does not ſay in what Language they Diſputed (for the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> underſtand neither <hi>Latin</hi> nor <hi>Portugueſe</hi>) how they expreſs'd themſelves when they mention'd the words <hi>Eſſence, Perſon,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> how they explain'd Equivocal words, or how the Interpreters render'd them, whether they could not agree upon the common <hi>word,</hi> or whether the word <hi>Subſtance</hi> diſpleas'd, as fearing that to grant two <hi>Subſtances,</hi> would be to grant two Perſons, I leave to farther enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nor can I find out in ſo much Variety and Ambiguity of words, what word is moſt proper to be us'd in our ſenſe for the word Nature. For the <hi>Jacobites</hi> when they make uſe of the Arabic <hi>Tabia,</hi> or the Ethiopic <hi>Tabaje,</hi> which anſwers to the Greek word <hi>Phyſis,</hi> and by the <hi>Copts</hi> is call'd <hi>D Phyſis,</hi> apply it only to things created, more eſpecially to the Elements, but never to the <hi>Godhead:</hi> which the <hi>Melkites</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> being deſtitute of any other, make no ſcruple to do. Hence the Contention. For thus ſaith <hi>Eutychius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a <hi>Melkite;</hi> In Chriſt there are,
<q>Two Subſtances, a Subſtance of Divinity, and a Subſtance of Humanity; but one Perſon. To every Subſtance there belongs a Nature; and ſo two Subſtances, two Natures, but one Perſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this reaſon, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where this unhappy difference ſtill remains, when the <hi>Copts</hi> cry out in Arabic <hi>Maſhiah Wahid, Tabiah Wahid, One Will, one Nature;</hi> the Melkites anſwer, <hi>Maſhiatan tabiahtan, Two Wills, two Natures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1634. an <hi>European</hi> of great Quality reſiding in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and having vievv'd and read the Books of the <hi>Copts,</hi> deliver'd his Opinion aftervvards, <hi>That the difference and quarrel of the Parties proceeded more from a fear of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, than from the Thing it ſelf. For the</hi> Greeks <hi>are for the Destruction of thoſe Hereticks that confuſe and mix the Divinity

                  </p>
                  <p>Which if it be ſo, that the Contention and Debate, either formerly, or now, is only about the ſence of words, What Tears and Lamentations can ſuffice to bewail the ſad Effects of ſuch an Unfortunate Pedantic Brabble? What breaſt that lodges a heart ſo hard, that can refrain from bemoaning the ſad and calamitous Contentions of thoſe, to whom Chriſt has ſo earneſtly recommended the moſt ſtrict Bonds of Charity by his own Example? Humanity one would think, ſhould not be ſo inhuman, for the ſake of one word <hi>Nature</hi> miſunderſtood, to tear up the foundations of Concord between thoſe, whoſe Nature the Eternal Word has aſſum'd into his moſt Holy Subſiſtence. But as it is the Infirmity of our moſt corrupted Nature, where Ambition, from Ambition Emulation, from Emulation Envy, from Envy Hatred have taken root, that the Mind poſſeſs'd with various Paſſions and Affections, ſeeks no farther after Truth, hence it is that Men with Ears obſtructed, and blinded Eyes, purſue diſputes to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their private Ends; not conſidering the true end of Arguing and Diſpute.</p>

The <hi>Grecian</hi> Chriſtians, who were in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Emperor, adher'd to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of the <hi>Melkites;</hi> The reſt who inhabited the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and among them the <hi>Axumites,</hi> follow'd the Patriarch of the <hi>Jacobites;</hi> and thus being rent not only from the <hi>Greek,</hi> but <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they had little or no knowledge of either. After this, the Power of the <hi>Saracens</hi> increaſing, and all <hi>Egypt</hi> being by them ſubdu'd, all Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and Communication of Arts and Knowledge ceas'd between <hi>Them,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of our part of the World. Nevertheleſs ſome glimpſes they had of the <hi>Roman Pontiffs,</hi> from the Acts of the Ancient Councils, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd them as Chief among the Oecunomical Patriarchs. On the other ſide the Pope laying hold of the occaſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to Re-eſtabliſh the former Correſpondence and Amity, not taking any notice of their being <hi>Monothelites,</hi>

or Favourers of the condemn'd <hi>Dioſcurus.</hi> To this purpoſe <hi>Baronius</hi> has ſet forth an Epiſtle taken out of <hi>Roger</hi>'s <hi>Engliſh Annals,</hi> written by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, with this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. <hi>To our moſt dear Son in Chriſt, the Illuſtrious and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent King of the</hi> Indians, <hi>the most Holy of Priests.</hi> Which Epiſtle he erroneouſly believes to have bin written to <hi>Prester John,</hi> whoſe Dominions were then very large in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> For that when <hi>Baronius</hi> wrote, the King of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> was reputed and commonly taken for <hi>Prester John.</hi> But when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third liv'd, the real <hi>Preſter John</hi> was then reigning in <hi>Aſia.</hi> Neither is any thing to be gather'd out of that whole Epiſtle, that has any Relation to <hi>Africa,</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or the King of the <hi>Habeſsines;</hi> nor are the Conſequences of that Letter known to <hi>Baronius.</hi> Only upon that occaſion, he conjectures that the Church of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> with the Buildings behind St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Cathedral, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſſign'd to the <hi>Habeſsinians;</hi> though he is not certain by whom that Aſſignation was made, whether by <hi>Alexander</hi> or any other Succeeding Pope. Therefore, if the Epiſtle were real, we rather think it was written to the Aſiatic <hi>Preſter John,</hi> then to the King of the <hi>Ethiopians.</hi> Others there are, that believe there was an <hi>Abeſsinian</hi> Embaſſy to <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, reſiding at <hi>Avignon.</hi> Nor is there any doubt made of the Embaſſy which <hi>Zera-Jacob</hi> ſent to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, in the year 1439. toward the Concluſion of the Council of <hi>Florence. Gregory</hi> had known nothing of it, had he not ſeen the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador and his Retinue painted at <hi>Rome,</hi> and known his own Countrymen by their Habit.</p>
                  <p>In the former Century, <hi>Francis Alvarez,</hi> Prieſt to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Ambaſſadors ſent into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> brought Letters from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, which he delivered to the Pope in a public Aſſembly of the Cardinals, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth being there alſo preſent, promiſing Reverence and Obedience withal to the Holy See, in the Name of the King of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi> It was a thing very grateful to the Pope, that at a time when ſo many Northern Nations had revolted from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> See, ſo many Kingdoms of the Eaſt and South, ſhould voluntarily ſubmit to his Juriſdiction. For which reaſon, neither <hi>Alvarez</hi>'s Credentials, nor the words of the Epiſtle were over-nicely examin'd, nor any extraordinary Scrutiny made to what Church, or what ſort of Religion the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was enclin'd, to the end that had it been needful, he might
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59633:150"/>
have bin abſolv'd from the guilt of Hereſie, before his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Boſom of the Church. For as we ſhall afterwards declare, the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> made quite another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of their King's Intention. In the mean time a certain form of Friendſhip long remain'd. For when <hi>John Bermudes</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> to crave Aſſiſtance from the <hi>Europeans</hi> in the behalf of <hi>David,</hi> ſo often vanquiſh'd by the <hi>Adelans; Paul</hi> the Third, hearing that the ſaid <hi>Bermudes</hi> was by <hi>Mark</hi> the Metropolitan, nominated his Succeſſor, and inveſted with Holy Orders, made no ſcruple to confirm him, and to ratifie the Ordination of a Schiſmatical Prelate. There were then reſiding certain <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> very good Men, who Printed the New Teſtament with their Liturgies in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopic Language, whom the Pope did not only tolerate, but aſſiſted at his own Expences. In recompence of which Kindneſſes, they extoll'd and applauded the Benevolence of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Munificence of the Chief Pontiff, and his Spiritual Daughter <hi>Hyeronyma Farneſia,</hi> and acknowledg'd the Pope as the Head and Supream over all the Orthodox Chriſtians. <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth alſo in his Letters to <hi>Menas,</hi> tho a profeſſed Enemy to the <hi>Romans,</hi> call'd him his <hi>moſt dear Son;</hi> whether he were ignorant of his hatred to the <hi>Latins,</hi> which was a wonder; or whether he had hopes to reclaim him by flattering Titles, which <hi>Godignus</hi> rather conjectures to be the Pope's true Intention. For this reaſon, ſome there were who believ'd the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> to be Catholicks in the higheſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſubject to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> tho <hi>Tellez</hi> deſervedly taxes and derides their Credulity. Nevertheleſs a vain hope had poſſeſſed the Minds of many of the more Zealous ſort, that that vaſt Kingdom, then look'd upon to be four times as big as really it was, might in a ſhort time, with little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, be annexed to the Pontifical Juriſdiction. Among the reſt, the Founder of the Society of <hi>Jeſus, Ignatius Loyola,</hi> bent all his Study to bring it to paſs, and to that end he ſhew'd a moſt Ardent deſire to go himſelf, and win the honour of Converting <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> Which tho <hi>Julius</hi> the Third would not grant him the liberty to do, nevertheleſs he ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with him, that by the connivance of <hi>John</hi> the Third King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Patriarchal Dignity was conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>John Nonius Barret,</hi> one of his Companions, contrary to the Inſtitutions of his Society, tho <hi>Bermudes</hi> were then in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> already dignify'd with the ſame Title. With him
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59633:151"/>
was joyn'd <hi>Andrew Oviedo,</hi> a Biſhop, that if <hi>Barret</hi> through Mortality ſhould miſcarry, he might not want an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Succeſſor. They, Embarking in ſeveral Ships, ſayl'd into <hi>India.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Claudius</hi> was become Succeſſor to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his Father, whoſe affection they thought it firſt expedient to ſound, before the Patriarch ſhould expoſe himſelf to Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties and Indignities. <hi>Jacobus Dias</hi> was therefore ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, together with <hi>Gonſales Rodriguez,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentio Freyre,</hi> Jeſuits; who toward the beginning of <hi>February</hi> ſetting Sail from <hi>Goâ,</hi> and a Month after arriving at the Port of <hi>Arkiko,</hi> were there curteouſly receiv'd by the Preſident of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Province, and within the ſpace of two Months brought to the King. Who underſtanding that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was about to ſend Prieſts, and other Eccleſiaſtical Perſons to teach him and his People a new Religion, was very much perplex'd in his Mind, and long in Suſpence what anſwer to return; for he neither thought it convenient to admit them, neither was he willing to offend the King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> However he ventur'd upon ſeveral Colloquies with the Envoys, the ſum of which, manag'd for the moſt part by <hi>Gonſalez,</hi> tended to this, <hi>That the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>was Chriſt's Vicar upon Earth, and the Supream Head of all Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and therefore if the</hi> Habeſſines <hi>were deſirous of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, they ſhould once more return and joyn themſelves to their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Head; for that Chriſt himſelf had from his own lips aſſerted, that his Church was but one Fold, and over that but one Shepheard,</hi> &amp;c. On the other ſide, the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> made anſwer, <hi>That an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of ſo great Conſequence was to be conſider'd and conſulted upon with the other Patriarchs; for to abandon their ancient Rites and Ceremonies upon private admonition, and receive new ones, was a thing full of danger and offence.</hi> At length the King told them, <hi>That if thoſe Perſons whom the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>ſhould ſend, would take the pains to come to</hi> Matzua, <hi>he would order ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be there, both to give them a befitting Reception, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them to his Court.</hi> Beſides all this, the King was no leſs fearful, leaſt the <hi>Portugals,</hi> as it had befallen ſeveral other Kings in <hi>India,</hi> ſhould make him their Tributary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of Religion, powre into his Country a great force of Soldiers, Arm'd and furniſh'd with Fire-Arms; Eſpecially remembring what great Exploits a ſmall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Portugals</hi> had perform'd in his Kingdom but a few years before. A Jealouſie that not long after increas'd to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59633:151"/>
that height, that when King <hi>David</hi> had ſeriouſly negotiated with <hi>Roderigo Limez,</hi> the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſador, about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Fortification of <hi>Matzua,</hi> and <hi>Suaqena,</hi> and had alſo offer'd aſſiſtance of Forces, Proviſion and Money, afterwards the Buſineſs was not only no farther mention'd, but alſo the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Aid, ſo neceſſary, and ſo much deſir'd was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refus'd; ſo that he choſe rather to leave the Port of <hi>Arkiko,</hi> with the Iſland adjoyning, in the hands of the <hi>Turk,</hi> then to give Admiſſion to the <hi>Portugals. So prevalent is the fear of Foreign Domination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Claudius</hi>'s anſwer being return'd into <hi>India,</hi> ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd the Patriarch <hi>Barret,</hi> and his Aſſociates, who imagin'd that all things would have bin ſmooth and eaſie according to their wiſhes. Thereupon after long delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they came to this reſult, <hi>Leſt the Patriarchal Dignity ſhould be hazarded with a Prince ill affected, which would be to the Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pontifical Authority, and a contempt of the King of</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, <hi>by whoſe recommendation and favour they were ſent, that the Patriarch ſhould remain in</hi> India <hi>with</hi> Melchior Caymero <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Nice, <hi>and that</hi> Oviedo <hi>ſhould go alone, to the end he might take his meaſures by the Event of</hi> Oviedo<hi>'s Succeſs. Oviedo</hi> being thus diſpatch'd away with Five more Aſſociates, was kindly receiv'd by <hi>Iſaac</hi> at that time <hi>Bahrnagaſs,</hi> or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Sea-Ports. The Common People ignorant of their Errand, nor altogether averſe to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, receiv'd the Biſhop and his Aſſociates with great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Kindneſs, even to the kiſſing their hands. The Romaniſts laying hold upon the occaſion, reſolv'd upon a <hi>Proceſsion</hi> from their own to the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Church, and were by them beheld with mutual Charity, without the leaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brading or reproach of the Novelty. The King alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd them with great kindneſs; only he took it ill that they ſhould talk to him of yielding obedience to the <hi>Roman Pontiff.</hi> Nevertheleſs as he was a moſt Prudent Perſon, and worthy the high Dignity he enjoy'd, he always carry'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſo great Moderation toward the Biſhop, that he ſtill left him with ſome hopes of Succeſs. In the mean time the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion was every where freely exercis'd, and no man forbid who defir'd to embrace it. But the Biſhop not content with ſo much favour, began to preſs the King more urgently, <hi>That at length without more delay, he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontiff.</hi> He reply'd, <hi>That his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59633:152"/>
had in ſacred things given their Obedience to none but the Succeſſors of St.</hi> Mark; <hi>nor did he ſee any cauſe why he ſhould deſire Innovation, and diſturb his People well contented with their</hi> Abuna? But the Biſhop ſtill continuing his Importunity, The King told him, <hi>That ſince he was come to him from a Region ſo far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant upon ſo honeſt a Negotiation, he would conſult with his Friends and his Learned Men upon a Matter of ſo great Importance. Oviedo</hi> underſtanding that the King did nothing but ſpin out delays; and hearing withal, that the King's Mother, and all the Blood Royal, together with the Nobility and greateſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Nation were utterly averſe to any Alterations, wrote an Epiſtle to the King, wherein he put him in Mind, <hi>That his Father had acknowledg'd the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>for the Vicar of Christ; that ſeveral of his Learned men had beſought him; that</hi> Claudius <hi>had wrote to the King of</hi> Portugal; <hi>and that his Father had Commanded, that they ſhould not deſire an</hi> Abuna <hi>from any other place then from</hi> Rome: <hi>and that He himſelf had publickly promis'd Obedience to thee See of</hi> Rome. <hi>That if any doubt remain'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any Articles of Faith, he ſhould bring thoſe things to a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſpute, and hear the Arguments on both ſides: it being but juſt, that the Party that was foil'd, ſhould acknowledge and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low what the other had maintain'd for Truth: and that the King ſhould well conſider whoſe advice he took, or what Perſons he conſulted in ſo important an Affair. That the Ends and Intereſt of Parents or Kindred were not to be regarded: That the love of Christ was to be preferr'd before the love of Relations, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſied in Teaching his own Doctrine in the Temple of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>would not make uſe of his moſt Holy Mothers advice; by which he ſhew'd, that in the Cauſe of God no Man is bound to Communicate his Intentions to his nearest Friends.</hi> Whether the King made any Anſwer, or what it was, is not known. But <hi>Gregory</hi> told me, That the ſence of the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Letters, was quite different from the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Alvarez, Bermudes</hi> and others addicted to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion made of them at <hi>Rome:</hi> and that it could not be otherwiſe, in regard that before the Reign of <hi>Suſneus,</hi> the <hi>Habesſines</hi> had never known what that Obedience meant. Hower the King, that he might not ſeem to diſtruſt the ſtrength of his own Cauſe, and the learning of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, permitted frequent Diſputes, not yet made Publick by the Fathers of the Society. From this <hi>Tellez</hi> reports, <hi>That the</hi> Habeſſine <hi>Doctors appear'd very ignorant and illiterate in all
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59633:152"/>
their Diſputes; as never having Study'd Logic, Syllogiſms, nor En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymemes, nor having any knowledge of the Subtleties of Scholastic Divinity.</hi> From whence the Reader may readily Judge of the Progreſs and Events of ſuch Diſputes. <hi>Tellez</hi> goes on, and ſays, <hi>That</hi> Claudius <hi>

                        </gap>ary of the illiterateneſs of his own People, for the most part undertook the Diſcourſe himſelf, and gave</hi> Oviedo <hi>not a little Trouble.</hi> Moreover he complains, <hi>That the</hi> Habeſſines, <hi>when they were worſted, would never acknowledge it, but always boasted of the Victory, and ſo all thoſe Diſputes came to nothing.</hi> It was therefore thought more convenient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to <hi>writing.</hi> Nor did the King decline the Combat, but anſwer'd them with other Writings, tho they have not as yet bin permitted to viſit the <hi>European</hi> Regions. <hi>Oviedo</hi> impatient of his ill Succeſs, and finding he could not bring the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Prince to do as he would have had him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to a more ſevere but unſeaſonable courſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to teſtifie his Indignation, he left the Court, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd a Writing, <hi>Where in he branded the</hi> Habeſſines <hi>with ſeveral Hereſies, and exhorted his</hi> Portugueſes <hi>to have a care of them.</hi> Which did not a little offend <hi>Claudius.</hi> For a mind free, and ſubject to none, when once it refuſes the perſuaſion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, is the more exaſperated by affront and reviling. Nor can it be thought that any Prince will ſuffer himſelf and his Subjects to be traduc'd for Heretics within his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                  <p>Not long after <hi>Claudius</hi> was ſlain in a Battel againſt the <hi>Adelans;</hi> to whom, in regard he dy'd without Iſſue, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adamas-Saghed</hi> Succeeded, a Perſon quite of another diſpoſition, as one that retain'd nothing of his Moderation or Clemency. For whatever Indulgencies <hi>Claudius</hi> had granted to <hi>Oviedo,</hi> and the Embracers of his Doctrine, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd them all; nor would he ſo much as permit that the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Women, who were Marry'd to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> ſhould exerciſe the Religion of their Husbands; to which he added many other ſevere Edicts, declaring openly, <hi>That his Brother was therefore puniſh'd by God, becauſe he did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Religion of the</hi> Franks; as it is frequent to attribute Adverſity or Proſperity to neglected or protected Religion. Nay, he proceeded ſo far, that having ſent for <hi>Oviedo,</hi> he threaten'd him with Death, if he continu'd divulging and ſowing <hi>Roman</hi> Paradoxes in his Dominions. Which when the Biſhop refus'd to conſent to, ſaying, <hi>That God was to be
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59633:153"/>
obey'd, rather then Man,</hi> he drew his Scymiter in a rage, and unleſs the Queen, and ſome of the chief Nobility had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him, had undoubtedly diſpatch'd the Biſhop to the other World. The Biſhop therefore, in this deſperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Affairs retires to <hi>Fremona,</hi> where he lay conceal'd, thirty whole years together, and aſſuming to himſelf, after the Death of <hi>Barret,</hi> the Title of Patriarch, officiated among his own <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> without any further moleſtation: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that <hi>Melec-Saghed</hi> after his Father's violent Death, ſhew'd himſelf more mild, and temperate to the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who behaving themſelves more modeſtly, gave him no cauſe of Provocation. But at length all the Avenues into <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> being ſhut-up by the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the Fathers that were ſent thither being all taken and ſlain, the State of Religion among the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> was reduc'd to that extremity, that all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being deceas'd, there was none remain'd alive to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate Divine Service. At length <hi>Melchior Silvanus</hi> an Indian, Vicar of the Church of St. <hi>Anns</hi> in <hi>Goa,</hi> and for that reaſon diſguis'd both by his Language and Colour, ventur'd into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and there officiated till the Arrival of <hi>Peter Pays;</hi> after which he return'd into <hi>India,</hi> leaving the ſaid <hi>Peter,</hi> as he had bin before, all alone in his office of Prieſthood.</p>

                  <p>THE Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> and the Fathers of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety were not ignorant of the afflicted Condition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip in <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereas before they had conceiv'd vaſt hope of Total Converſion of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> now the caſe was ſo far alter'd, that they found themſelves put to a Neceſſity of providing for their own few Countrymen, leaſt they ſhould be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Proviſion for the Salvation of their own Souls, as not having any Prieſts to perform Religious Duties among them. Mov'd therefore by the Inſtigation of Conſcience, they took it into ſerious Conſideration, leaſt while they were buſyed about Subjecting <hi>Abaſsia</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> that nothing belong'd to it, they ſhould looſe their own Countrymen, Profeſſors of their own Religion, who had reaſon enough to forſake thoſe that forſook them. And therefore they made it their whole ſtudy how to ſupply them with Prieſts, to govern their Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. And indeed many had attempted the Journey, but in vain.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59633:154"/>
Till at length with the dawn of the new Century, new hopes began to ſhine forth. For <hi>Peter Pays,</hi> after his firſt unfortunate Attempt, which had expos'd him to various Hazards, and a Captivity in <hi>Arabia,</hi> undertook a ſecond Journey into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> wherein he proſperouſly Succeeded; being well skill'd both in the Countries, Cuſtoms and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Languages, and able to endure the temperature of thoſe Climates. <hi>John Gabriel</hi> a famous <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Collonel, had given King <hi>Jacob</hi> then reigning, notice of his coming, and had ſo poſſeſs'd the young Prince with the worth of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by the high Commendations which he gave him, that ſo ſoon as the Winter was over, the King ſent for him. But he being ſoon after depos'd, <hi>Zadenghel</hi> was advanc'd in his Room. Thereupon <hi>Peter Pays</hi> kept himſelf ſtill at <hi>Fremona;</hi> where, not believing his time could be better ſpent than in inſtructing the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Children, he choſe out ſome of the riper Ingenuities, and in a ſhort time ſo manur'd them, that they were able to anſwer to any Queſtion propounded to them concerning the Chriſtian Faith. A thing both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted and wonderful to the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> to hear from Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren what they could hardly expect from Perſons of years and Experience. But conſidering the Perſon, he was not ſo much wonderful neither; for he was a Man of a quick and ready Wit, that could fit himſelf to all Humours, of an affable and complaiſant Temper, and well skill'd not only in the Liberal Sciences, but Mechanic Arts. The fame of ſo acute and laborious a Perſon, and ſo happy in his Inſtruction, being ſpread over the Neighbouring Regions, in a ſhort time reach'd the young King's Ears; who being covetous to ſee ſuch a Maſter and ſuch Scholars, by his Letters invited him to Court. Thereupon in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1604. accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with two <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Youths arriving at Court, he was honourably receiv'd by the King, as if he had bin one of the Nobles of his Kingdom, not without great diſtaſt taken by the Monks, whoſe Sloth compar'd to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Diligence and Induſtry, render'd them contemptible to moſt. The next day ſeveral Diſputes began about Controverſies in Religion, which the King was pleas'd both favourably and patiently to hear; Maſs was alſo ſaid after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, and a Sermon Preach'd; with which <hi>Zadenghel</hi> was ſo taken, that having Communicated his Intentions to ſome of his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends, he reſolv'd to ſubmit himſelf to the Pope.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59633:154"/>
But in regard he durſt not adventure to do it publickly, he firſt conjur'd <hi>Peter</hi> not to reveal the Secret, and then told him, <hi>That he was Convinc'd by his Arguments, that there was no other Univerſal Paſtor and Vicar of Chriſt upon Earth beſide the Pope of</hi> Rome. <hi>That to deny it to him, was to deny it to Chriſt; that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did not follow his Example, was not of the true Church; and that therefore he had Decreed to requeſt a Patriarch and Fathers from</hi> Rome <hi>to inſtruct his People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Altho ſo ſudden and ſo unexpected a Declaration of a King could not chooſe but infuſe a joy unſpeakable into the heart of <hi>Peter,</hi> yet he contain'd himſelf; only what his duty bound him to, he could not but highly extol the Pious Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the King. Nor did the King delay: The Secret with which he had truſted <hi>Peter</hi> under Oath, he himſelf made Publick, and preſently ſet forth an Edict, <hi>That no Perſon ſhould any longer obſerve the Sabbath as a Holy day.</hi> And indeed he was ſo forward, that <hi>Peter</hi> was fain to check his Celerity, and put a ſtop to his Career. However Letters were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Clement</hi> the VIII. and <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and deliver'd to <hi>Peter</hi>'s care, for their ſafe and honourable conveyance. In theſe Letters <hi>he offer'd his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, his Soldiers, and his Workmen; and withal requested ſome of the Fathers of the Society of Jeſus to inſtruct his Subjects.</hi> Theſe things were not ſo privately carry'd, but that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by ſome of the chief Nobility of the Kingdom, who were no way ſatisfy'd at theſe underminings of their ancient Religion: wherefore they conſpir'd againſt their Prince, and flew him in Battel. <hi>Zadenghel</hi> being ſlain, all <hi>Peter</hi>'s great Hopes vaniſh'd of a ſudden, not only through <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denghel</hi>'s fall, but by reaſon of the Civil Wars that enſu'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Suſneus,</hi> contending for the Royal Diadem. And ſo all Promotion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion ſurceas'd, till <hi>Jacob</hi> being vanquiſh'd and kill'd in the Field, <hi>Suſneus</hi> became Lord of <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> Who again kindly receiv'd and entertain'd <hi>Peter</hi> together with his Companions, and to all his Requeſts lent a moſt gracious Ear.</p>
                  <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Affairs of <hi>Habeſsinia,</hi> were then but in a Low Condition, there not having bin any Peace in the Country for about Fourſcore years: ſo that perpetual Wars had almoſt extinguiſh'd the Studies of peaceful Arts; nor were there enough to perform Religious Duties in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but leſs to obviate the Encroachment of inſinuating
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59633:155"/>
Errors and Abuſes in Religion. The Metropolitans, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the moſt part the moſt ignorant that could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, took no more Cognizance of the Churches which they were appointed to govern, then if they had bin under Foreign Juriſdiction, only they took up their time in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of all ſorts without any due Examination. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and his Nobility obſerving the Diligence of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in inſtructing the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Youth; their Zeal in the Converſion of the People; their Eloquence in Preaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of before, their Sanctity of living, ſo neceſſary among <hi>Neophytes</hi> and <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> were poſſeſs'd with ſo much Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Affection toward them, that they could promiſe to themſelves no other way for reſtoring their decay'd Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Worſhip, but by their means. Therefore Letters were ſent to the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to requeſt their Friendſhip, and the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Portugueſes. Peter Pays</hi> enlarg'd upon the ſame Subject, and added much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King's Affection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſputations alſo were appointed, of which the chief Theme was concerning the <hi>two Natures in Christ,</hi> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily demonſtrable out of the Writings of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> themſelves, gave the <hi>Fathers</hi> great Advantage over the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Doctors.</p>
                  <p>The Chiefeſt of all the Nobility, <hi>Ras-Seelaxus</hi> the King's Brother by the Mother's ſide, publickly profeſſed the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and receiv'd the Euchariſt openly, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Manner, whoſe example many of the Great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Army, both Collonels and Captains follow'd; eſpecially ſeeing the King's favour ſo conſtant toward the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi> At length the King himſelf, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Anſwer of <hi>Paul</hi> the V. in a Letter dated the 31 of <hi>January,</hi> 1623. <hi>Promis'd to yield him Obedience as Univerſal Paſtor of the Church, and that he would admit a Patriarch ſent from</hi> Rome, <hi>ſo that neceſſary Succors were ſent him withal, without which, it was impoſsible to accompliſh a buſineſs of ſo much Difficulty and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> He alſo ſignified his Intentions to ſend an Embaſſador with Father <hi>Antonio Fernandez,</hi> after another manner, and in another Equipage, then had yet bin uſual. To ſay truth, the King publickly favour'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, without any oppoſition; in regard that the Sword had cut off the greateſt part of the ſtiffeſt and moſt obſtinate Defenders of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Worſhip. Only the <hi>Monks</hi> remain'd behind,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59633:155"/>
who were baffled ſtill in all their Attempts of Diſpute. Therefore the King, to the end he might make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to his whole Kingdom, that he had not raſhly, but upon Mature Deliberation, and as it were overcome by the force of Truth, given way to a new Religion, appointed a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Diſpute, where he enjoyn'd moſt of the Nobility of his Kingdom to be preſent. The Subject of the Diſputation was again the repeated Queſtion concerning the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt; as if that had bin the utmoſt limit of all their Controverſies. And no queſtion it might be true what <hi>Tellez</hi> has written, that the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> were vanquiſh'd upon the firſt onſet. For the reality of the thing ſupported by ſo many Authorities and Reaſons afforded an eaſie Victory. Nevertheleſs there was another Diſpute appointed ſome few days after, which prov'd no leſs ſucceſsful than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Wherefore the King, as if the War had now bin at an end, and that now Truth had merited her Triumph, put forth an Edict, that all Perſons for the future ſhould believe and hold, <hi>That there were two Natures in Chriſt, between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves really diſtinct, but united in one Divine Perſon.</hi> This Edict was little regarded by one particular <hi>Monk,</hi> more wilful and ſtubborn than truly zealous, who being for his Contumacy brought before the King, and ſpeaking in his preſence more irreverently than became him, was ſeverely Scourg'd for his ſawcineſs. Of the Pain and Anguiſh of which Chaſtiſement, tho the Monk was only ſenſible, yet the fear of it kept others in awe, who not underſtanding that he was puniſh'd for his malapertneſs, thought he had bin ſo ſeverely dealt with for denying the <hi>two Natures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things being ſpread abroad, <hi>Simeon</hi> the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, at that time abſent, haſtens to the King with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>That unuſual things had bin done without his knowledge, and that Diſputes about Religion had bin appointed in his abſence.</hi> The King well underſtanding how unable he was to grapple with the Fathers in Diſpute, made him anſwer, <hi>That ſince he was come, he would appoint the ſame Diſputations to be heard over again.</hi> To which <hi>Simeon</hi> had not a word to ſay. And thus a ſecond Victory being won from the Primate of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a more ſevere Edict concerning the <hi>two Natures</hi> was publiſh'd by the <hi>Cryer,</hi> making it Death for any Perſon to deny the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:59633:156"/>By this ſo ſharp a Decree, as if it had bin the loud ſignal to Battel, it is incredible to think how the minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were incens'd. As for the Controverſie it ſelf, they did not think it of ſo high a Concernment, as to engage divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parties in Blood and Maſſacre about it. <hi>In regard that all acknowledg'd both Divinity and Humanity in Chriſt; ſo that the Queſtion was only about a word. But let the Queſtion be what it would, ſuch a ſevere way of proceeding was never heard of before in</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>as being altogether contradictory to the mildneſs of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Lenity of the Primitive times. So then if Men were to be ſcourg'd and whipp'd, becauſe they could not apprehend two Natures in Chriſt, what muſt they expect if other Queſtions ſhould be ſtarted about Innovations of greater difficulty in the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the Fathers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Exaſperated with theſe fair pretences, <hi>Simeon</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, together with ſeveral of the Nobility; and among the reſt <hi>Jamanaxus,</hi> alias <hi>Emana Chriſtos,</hi> another of the King's Brothers by the Mothers ſide; and laſtly, almoſt all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted Clergy and Monks met, and held Conſultations together to prevent the threatning Miſchiefs; and laſtly, combin'd <hi>to live and dye for the Defence of their ancient and ſettled Religion.</hi> To this end <hi>Simeon,</hi> under pretence of incumbent Duty, which was to be watchful over the Preſervation of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Religion, fix'd an <hi>Excommunication</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly upon the Dores of the great Church belonging to the Camp, againſt all that embrac'd the Religion of the <hi>Franks,</hi> or ventur'd to Diſpute concerning it. The King, tho high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended with this unexpected boldneſs of the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, durſt not adventure to revenge himſelf; However he Publiſh'd another Edict, <hi>whereby Liberty was granted to every Perſon that ſo pleas'd, to embrace and exerciſe the Fathers Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion already eſtabliſh'd by fair Diſputes and Arguments on their ſide.</hi> Which ſo little terrify'd the undaunted Metropolitan, that he thunder'd out his Anathema's againſt all that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd <hi>two Natures in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Moderate Party bewail'd theſe Paper Skirmiſhes, which they foreſaw would break forth, <hi>and end in Slaughter and Miſery, and that the King's Decrees would never be eſtabliſh'd without the effuſion of much Blood.</hi> Senſible of theſe Fears, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the great Perſonages of the Kingdom, together with the King's Mother, <hi>Ite-Hamelmala,</hi> moſt earneſtly beſought the King, to deſiſt from what he had begun, and not to raiſe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59633:156"/>
up implacable Seditions to the Ruin of himſelf and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. After which the Metropolitan, with many Monks and Nuns came to the Camp, and implor'd the King, not to innovate any thing in Religion, otherwiſe that they were prepar'd to lay down their lives for the Religion of their Anceſtors. At laſt the King referr'd the whole Buſineſs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Colloquie, which continu'd for Six days one after another, but without any Succeſs: A clear Teſtimony that Controverſies in Religion are not to be decided by Diſputes. After that, all the Clergy throw themſelves at the King's Feet, and with Sighs and Tears beſeech him, <hi>Not to change a Religion ſo quietly Eſtabliſh'd in</hi> Ethiopia <hi>for ſo many Ages, by ſo many of their Emperors.</hi> But nothing would prevail; the King remain'd inexorable and immoveable; ſo that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners departed full freighted with Exaſperation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Immediately, all hopes of Concord and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being lay'd aſide, the Sword was next unſheath'd, whence follow'd thoſe terrible Commotions and Bloody Wars that have almoſt ruin'd the moſt flouriſhing part of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chief of the Conſpirators were <hi>Jamanaxus, Aelius</hi> the King's Son in Law, Viceroy of <hi>Tigra,</hi> the Eunuch <hi>Caflo,</hi> and ſeveral others. But to give the better Colour to their Rebellion, and Deſign of Killing the King, the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, caus'd a new and more ſevere Excommunication to be fix'd upon the Chief Church in the Camp, by which all the partakers of the Latin Religion were Anathematiz'd. In the mean time the Fathers of the Society relying upon the King's Favour, haſten'd to get all things ready that might be of advantage to Eſtabliſh their Doctrine. To that end they tranſlated <hi>Maldonatus</hi> upon the Four Evangeliſts; <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Ribera</hi> upon the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> and ſome others, into the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Language, which ſome eſteem'd, others by reaſon of the intermixture of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haric</hi> words, contemn'd, as full of Barbariſms and Soloeciſms. But as for the Lord's Prayer, and the Salutation of <hi>Mary,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but the Latin written in <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Characters, they abhorr'd 'em, as looking upon them to be nothing but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic Spells. On the other ſide, the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> fell upon the Fathers with all the bittereſt Invectives that might be; thoſe Paper Skirmiſhes being generally the fore-runners of more Bloody diſputes. In purſuance of which, <hi>Aelius</hi> by an
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59633:157"/>
Edict, Commands all the <hi>Franks</hi> to depart out of <hi>Tigra,</hi> and the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> to follow him: by which means, having muſter'd up a compleat Army, he openly Rebels. <hi>Simeon</hi> Curſes the <hi>Franks,</hi> but loads <hi>Aelius</hi> with his Bleſſings; upon which he no doubt relying, reſolv'd to fight his Father in Law, then upon his March againſt him with a ſtrong Force, notwithſtanding all the Perſwaſions of his Wife to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Fierce therefore, and in the heat of his young Blood, and over-confident of his own Faction, not ſtaying ſo much as to take his Breakfaſt, but as it were Drunk with Fury and Rage, only with a ſmall Troop about him, he leaps his Horſe into his Father's Camp, asking, <hi>Where the King was?</hi> and ſo what between the aſtoniſhment of ſome, and the wonder of others what the Matter ſhould be, he rode up without any hurt to the King's Pavilion; where at length the Alarum being taken, he was ſoon ſurrounded, Ston'd and Stabb'd to Death, and ſo dearly paid for his raſhneſs. The Captain thus Slain, the Soldiers betake themſelves to their heels; <hi>Simeon,</hi> between the Fugitives and the Purſuers, ſtood alone by himſelf, like a man ſtupifyed, whether not at firſt obſerv'd, or neglected as a Clergy-man, but at length being known, he was Slain among the Crowd. Both their Heads were ſent about the Kingdom, and expos'd as a Public Spectacle. The Eunuch <hi>Caflo</hi> had his Head ſtruck off: <hi>Jamanaxus</hi> was pardon'd. Thus the Kindred of Kings for the moſt part eſcape the Puniſhment of thoſe Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions to which they themſelves have given Life and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
                  <p>The King who was never fearful, now more emboldened by his Victory, now queſtions other Heads of Religion: and ſoon after by Public Edict prohibits the Obſervation of the Sabbath, as <hi>Judaical,</hi> and Repugnant to Chriſtianity. In anſwer to this Edict, ſome Perſon without a Name, had written contemptuouſly of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, reflecting ſeverely upon the Fathers of the Society, whom he call'd <hi>the Kindred of</hi> Pilate, as being a <hi>Roman,</hi> and withal ſharply menacing the King himſelf. <hi>Tellez</hi> reports, That it was ſtufft with places of Scripture, but nothing to the purpoſe. The King more incens'd by this Writing, renew'd the Edict about the Sabbath, and commanded the Husbandmen to Plough and Sow upon that Day, adding as a Penalty upon the Offenders, for the firſt Fault the Forfeiture of a weav'd
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:59633:157"/>
Veſtment to the value of a <hi>Portugal</hi> Patack; for the ſecond, Confiſcation of Goods, and that the ſaid Offence ſhould not be preſcribed to Seven years; a certain form uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in their more ſevere Decrees.</p>
                  <p>Certainly it muſt of neceſſity be true what <hi>Tellez</hi> reports of the Natural Piety of the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> ſince they were thus to be compell'd to the Neglect of the Sabbath by ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Laws, when we can hardly be induc'd by ſtricter Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties to obſerve the Lord's-Day. Among the reſt, one <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> a ſtout and famous Soldier, felt the utmoſt rigour of this Decree, for being accus'd to have obſerv'd the Sabbath, he was made a moſt ſevere Example, that others of leſs conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence might not think to expect any Mercy.</p>
                  <p>From thence <hi>Jonael</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Bagemdra</hi> took an occaſion to Revolt, alluring all to his Party who were diſpleaſed with the Edicts. Upon which News, many of the chiefeſt of the Court, both Men and Women, of which ſeveral were near allyed to the King, with Tears in their Eyes beſought him once more, not to expoſe himſelf and the Kingdom to Calamity, but to take Pity upon ſo many poor afflicted People, offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of meer Simplicity and Ignorance, and not to diſturb the Minds of his People with ſuch unſeaſonable Changes.</p>
                  <p>The King far from being mov'd with their Tears, but rather the more diſpleas'd to ſee ſo many all of one Mind, that at once he might anſwer all, confirm the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and terrifie the Headſtrong, having ſummon'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Chief Nobles and Commanders of his Army that attended the Court, in a ſhort, but grave Oration, put them in mind of paſt Tranſactions, upbraiding them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, <hi>For that they had depriv'd</hi> Zadenghel <hi>both of his Life and Kingdom, becauſe he had forſaken the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Religion to embrace the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith. That for his part, after his Victory obtain'd against</hi> Jacob, <hi>he had bin ſevere to none; but rather had pardon'd all; nevertheleſs he was diſturb'd with daily Seditions and Rebellions, under pretence of changing his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when he only reform'd it. For that he acknowledg'd as much and the ſame that others did, That</hi> Chriſt was true God, and true Man: <hi>but becauſe he could not be Perfect God, unleſs he had the Perfect Divine Nature, nor perfect Man without perfect Humane Nature, it follow'd, that there were two Natures in Chriſt, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one Subſtance of the Eternal Word. Which was not to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don but explain his Religion. In the next place he had abrogated
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:59633:158"/>
the Obſervation of the Sabbath Day, becauſe it became not</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>to obſerve the</hi> Jews <hi>Sabboth. Theſe things he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in favour of the</hi> Portugueſes; <hi>but becauſe it was the Truth it ſelf determin'd in the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>founded upon Scripture, and ever ſince the time of the Apoſtles deliver'd as it were from hand to hand; and if there were occaſion, he would lay down his life in defence of this Doctrine; but they who deny'd it ſhould firſt examine the Truth of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having finiſhed his Oration, a Letter was brought him from <hi>Jonael,</hi> containing many haughty Demands, and among the reſt the Expulſion of the Jeſuits. The King believing there would be no better way than to anſwer him in the Field, Commanded the nimbleſt of his Armed Bands to March: of which the Rebel having Intelligence, and not willing to abide his Fury fled for ſhelter among thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible Rocks, whither it was in vain to purſue him. Thereupon <hi>Suſneus,</hi> well-knowing that the Revolters would not be able long to endure the Inconveniencies, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that lodg'd among thoſe inacceſſible places, blockt him up at a Diſtance. So that <hi>Jonael</hi> at length, weaken'd by daily deſertions, fled to the <hi>Gallans,</hi> who being at variance among themſelves, kept their promis'd Faith but a ſhort time; for being underhand tempted with Rewards by the King; they at length turn'd their Protection into Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and ſlew the Unfortunate Implorer of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
                  <p>This Bad Succeſs however did not terrifie the Inhabitants of <hi>Damota,</hi> inhabiting the Southern parts of <hi>Gojam,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the News of the <hi>Prophanation of the Sabbath,</hi> as they called it, with their Hermites that ſculk'd in the Deſerts of that Province, ran to their Arms. <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> otherwiſe their Lord and Patron in vain Exhorting them to continue their Obedience, whoſe kind Meſſages of Peace and Pardon they refus'd, <hi>unleſs he would burn the Books Tranſlated out of</hi> Latin <hi>into the</hi> Habeſſine <hi>Language by the Fathers, and deliver up the</hi> Fathers <hi>themſelves to be Hang'd upon the higheſt Trees they could find.</hi> Thus deſpairing of Peace, <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi> ſet forward, tho deſerted by the greateſt part of his Forces, who favoured the Cauſe of their Countrymen; ſo that he had hardly Seven Thouſand Men that ſtook cloſe to him, while the Enemies Body daily encreas'd. However he reſolv'd to Fight them, knowing his Soldiers to be more Experienc'd,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59633:158"/>
and better Arm'd, beſides that he had about Forty <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Muſquetiers in his Camp. When they came to blows, the Victory fell to the King's Party, tho it coſt dear; in regard that about Four hundred Monks, that had as it were devoted themſelves to die for their Religion, fought moſt deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: of which a Hundred and fourſcore were Slain.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the King had not made Publick Profeſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, partly out of fear of ſtirring up Popular Tumults againſt him; partly being loath to diſmiſs his Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary Wives, and Concubines; but at length encourag'd by ſo many Victories he lay'd all fear aſide, and publickly renounc'd the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Worſhip, and confeſſing his Sins after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner to <hi>Peter Pays,</hi> diſmiſs'd all his Wives and Concubines, only the firſt of thoſe to which he had bin lawfully Marry'd. His Example convinc'd many others, who were not aſham'd to keep many Miſtreſſes, but Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes alſo. Not long after, the King ſignify'd his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion to his whole Empire, by a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Inſtrument, not without the Severe reproof of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Patriarch. The ſum of his <hi>Manifeſto</hi> was, <hi>That having deſerted the</hi> Alexandrinian, <hi>he now reverenced only the</hi> Roman <hi>See; and had yielded his Obedience to the</hi> Roman <hi>Pope, as the Succeſſor of</hi> Peter, <hi>the Prince of the Apoſtles; for that that See could never err either in Faith or good Manners,</hi> and then he exhorted his Subjects to do as he had done. He alſo diſcourſed at large concerning the two Natures in Chriſt, and tax'd the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Primates as guilty of many Errors. But neither the King's Example, nor his Exhortation wrought upon many. For at the ſame time his Son <hi>Gabriel</hi> began to ſtudy new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, tho with no better Succeſs than they who had taught him the way. For when he had intelligence that <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi> was marching againſt him, finding himſelf Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in Force, he betook himſelf to the inacceſſible Rocks of <hi>Shewa;</hi> from whence at laſt by the Craft of a certain well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brib'd <hi>Gallan,</hi> he was allur'd to come forth; who feigning himſelf to be highly offended with <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> came to the unwary young Prince, and promis'd him the Aſſiſtance of all his Friends; which while he was inveagled out to expect, in a neighbouring Wood, he was there ſurrounded by a ſelect Party of the Enemy, and pay'd for his raſh belief with the loſs of his Life.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Coming of the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch into <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſinia,</hi> and how he Managed his Affairs there.</head>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Alphonſus Mendez</hi> made Patriarch of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> His Inauguration and Journey to <hi>Goa,</hi> &amp;c. Their miſerable Reception at firſt. His difficult Paſſage by Land. Met by the Jeſuits. He comes to <hi>Fremona,</hi> thence to the King. The King ſwears Obedience to the Pope. So does the Court. <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi>'s behaviour blam'd. The Solemnity concluded with an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema. New Edicts in favour of the Romiſh Worſhip. The Women Commanded to ſwear. The Patriarchal See. New Diſturbances occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the new Computation. Baptiſm and Ordination reiterated: Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Viſitation and Confirmation. A Countryman's Joke. A Seminary. <hi>Tecla-George</hi> Revolts. Suppreſs'd and Hang'd. The Captain of the Guards excommunicated upon a ſlight Occaſion by the Patriarch; but Pardon'd at the King's interceſſion. Their Courtiers offended. Their Indignation increaſes, and why. A Witch impriſon'd by Command of the Patriarch: Which alienates the King's Affection from him. His Authority decreaſes, through private Grudges, and an Act of <hi>Ras Seelax.</hi> The <hi>Agawi</hi> Revolt. The King's ill Succeſs. <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi> more Proſperous againſt <hi>Luca-Marjam. Kebax</hi> kill'd and <hi>Teker-Egzi.</hi> Theſe Miſchiefs attributed to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Melcax</hi> takes upon him the Regal Power. <hi>Ras Seelax</hi> accus'd; His Goods confiſcated. The Fathers render'd odious to the King. Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies laugh'd at. <hi>Serthax</hi>'s unhappy Revolt. A New Expedition againſt the <hi>Laſti,</hi> Proſperous at firſt, at last <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate. The Fathers tax'd. The King indulges the Old Ceremonies. The Patriarch offended. Another more mild Edict; but too late.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>OF Theſe proſperous Succeſſes, the Fathers wrote preſently to <hi>Rome,</hi> and into <hi>Portugal.</hi> But very prudently, there was nothing raſhly decreed at firſt, leſt the Deſign of another Patriarch, like that of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Barret</hi> ſhould come to nothing. But when King <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> himſelf, had by his own Letters requeſted a Patriarch, and had made publick Profeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, the Conclave then thought it not expedient to make any longer delays. And therefore, as if they had bin to ſend into ſome <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Province, upon the Nomination of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, then King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as well as <hi>Spain, Alphonſus Mendez,</hi> a Perſon of great Eminency, by Nativity a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> a Doctor in Theology, and of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which claim'd <hi>Ethiopia</hi> peculiarly to it ſelf, as a Province by them wholly converted to the Faith, was created Patriarch.

Beſides, that it might have occaſion'd great Emulation, had a Perſon bin choſen out of any other Nation or Society. Being inaugurated with the uſual Ceremonies, at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1624. he ſet Sail, and arriv'd at <hi>Goa,</hi> where underſtanding that all things ſucceeded to the wiſhes of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> he prepar'd for his farther Journey. In <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> of the ſame year he arriv'd at <hi>Dios,</hi> hoping there to find ſome of the <hi>Bannian</hi> Veſſels, to carry him into the <hi>Red-Sea:</hi> But they being the year before over-burthen'd by the covetous Exactions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and fearing the <hi>Arabian</hi> Pirates had left off Trading into thoſe Parts. While he ſtay'd at <hi>Dio,</hi> he was ſeaſonably forewarn'd by the King's Letters, by no means to come near <hi>Suaqena</hi> or <hi>Matzua,</hi> but to make to rights for <hi>Baylur</hi> a Port of <hi>Dancala.</hi> There he arriv'd the Third of <hi>April</hi> following with ſix Companions, four <hi>Fathers;</hi> and two Friers.</p>

                  <p>The King had recommended him to the care of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Dancala,</hi> a Mahometan, but in Friendſhip with the <hi>Habeſsines.</hi> But the recommendation was ſo early, and he
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59633:160"/>
came ſo late, that the Viceroy had forgot it. So that his Reception there was very lamentable, there being little or no Proviſion, ſo much as of Neceſſaries made for him. And their Hoſts where they Lodg'd, were ſo poor and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, that inſtead of receiving any Kindneſſes from them, they were forc'd to purchaſe their ſorry Convenience with the continual Supplies of their Avarice. They could not get Mules or Horſes anow to carry themſelves and their Luggage; ſo that moſt of them were forc'd to travel over the rugged and parch'd Earth in continual conflict with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirſt, and intolerable heat.</p>
                  <p>Neither were they much better entertain'd for Sixteen days in the Court of the Viceroy himſelf, all their Preſents not ſufficing to gratifie the impatient Appetite of his Avarice. Parting from thence, at the Mercy of thoſe wicked and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Varlets that were their Guides and Owners of their Carriage-Horſes, they travel'd as they were led, in daily fear of the <hi>Gallans,</hi> over places where Battels had bin fought, as it were Pav'd with the Skulls and Bones of the Slain, till at laſt all theſe Difficulties and Dangers overcome, they were met by <hi>Emanuel Barradas,</hi> with ſome other <hi>Portugueſes</hi> and <hi>Habeſsines</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Tigra,</hi> who furniſh'd them with Proviſions, Carriages, and all other things neceſſary. Upon the ſtrength of which Refreſhments, they began to aſcend the towring Mountains of <hi>Abaſſia,</hi> and the Fifth day after, through more gladſom and verdant Fields, and more grateful opportunities of reſting themſelves, they arriv'd at <hi>Fremona;</hi> where they ſtay'd not only all the Winter, but all <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> being both unhealthy Months. In <hi>December</hi> they arriv'd at <hi>Gorgora,</hi> where upon a day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a Noble Attendance, and great Applauſe, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch enter'd the Camp, and after Maſs ſaid, was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into the King's Pavillion, and there by the King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſit down by him in a little Chair equal to his own. In which great Pomp and State, at length the Patriarch came to the point, and agreed with the King, that upon the XI day of <hi>February,</hi> 1626. he ſhould publickly ſwear Obedience to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Upon which day, together with the King and his Eldeſt Son <hi>Baſilides,</hi> appear'd the King's Brothers, the Viceroys and Governors of Provinces, and all others that were conſpicuous for their Dignity and Quality. In the Room were two
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59633:160"/>
little Chairs, but very rich, ſet one by the other; upon which the King ſate down on the right hand, and the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch in his Pontifical habit upon the left. Being ſo ſate, the Patriarch made a moſt lofty Panegyric in Praiſe of the Pope, not without ſome Reflections upon the Blindneſs of former Ages: then he fell to commemorate what had been done of later Times, How, <hi>That the Emperors of</hi> Habeſſinia <hi>had ſent their Embaſſadors formerly to</hi> Rome, <hi>and that lately one of them had requeſted thence a Paſtor, and Evangelical Preachers: that therefore now the Time was come, wherein his Majeſty was bound to ſatisfie the deſire of his Anceſtors, and to ſubmit himſelf and his Subjects to the See of</hi> Rome. The King Commanded the Grand Chamberlain of his Houſhold <hi>Melca Chriſtos,</hi> Prince of <hi>Samena</hi> to return an Anſwer; who after he had extoll'd the Merits of the <hi>Portugueſes, It is now the King's Intention,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to fulfil the Promiſes of his Anceſtors, by yielding Obedience to the</hi> Roman <hi>Pope;</hi> But as he was going on, the King interrupted him, ſaying, <hi>That this was not the firſt day of his Intention to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render his ſubmiſsion to the</hi> Roman <hi>Pope, as having long before promis'd it to the Superior Father of the Society of</hi> Jeſus. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Patriarch after a ſhort anſwer, unfolded a Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the four Evangeliſts; and then the King falling upon his Knees, took his Oath after this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We</hi> Sultan-Saghed <hi>King of the Kings of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>believe and confeſs, That St.</hi> Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, <hi>Prince of the Apostles was by Christ our Lord, Conſtituted Head of the whole Chriſtian Church, and that Principality and Power over the whole World was given to him when he ſaid,</hi> Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and I will give to thee the Keys of Heav'n; <hi>and at another Time when he ſaid to Him,</hi> Feed my Sheep. <hi>In like manner we believe, That the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>lawfully Elected, is the true Succeſſor of St.</hi> Peter <hi>the Apoſtle, in his Government, and that he has the ſame Power, Dignity, and Primacy of the whole Church of Chriſt. Therefore we Promiſe, Offer, and Swear true Obedience, and humbly ſubmit our Perſon and our Empire, at the feet of our Holy Father</hi> Urban <hi>the</hi> VIII. <hi>of that Name, by the Grace of God Pope, and our Lord, and to his Succeſſors in the Adminiſtration of the Church. So God help us, and theſe Holy Evangils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:59633:161"/>After the King had done, his Son <hi>Baſilides,</hi> the King's Brothers, all the Viceroys and Peers; as alſo all the Clergy and Monks then preſent took the ſame Oath.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> haſtily Drawing forth his Scimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, brake forth into theſe paſſionate Expreſſions: <hi>What is done, let it be done;</hi> that is to ſay, Let paſt things be forgotten; <hi>But whoever for the future ſhall not do it, ſince it becomes every one ſo to do, ſhall feel the weight of this.</hi> An Act, which to moſt that were preſent, ſeem'd very ſevere, eſpecially to thoſe who had taken part with <hi>Gabriel,</hi> at whom thoſe words were conſtru'd to be principally levell'd. Moreover, he added an unuſual Clauſe to his own Oath; <hi>That he alſo ſwore Allegiance to</hi> Baſilides <hi>as Heir and Succeſſor to his Father; and that he would alſo be his faithful Vaſſal, ſo that he would promiſe to Protect and Defend the Holy Catholic Faith; otherwiſe that he would be the firſt and most profeſs'd of his Enemies.</hi> As if it had bin lawful for a Subject to impoſe new Conditions of his Subjection upon a moſt Abſolute Prince and Monarch, not bound by any Laws of Man, ſuch as is the King of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſsinia.</hi> However the King ſaid nothing, nor durſt <hi>Baſilides,</hi> as being under the Tuition of his Father, take notice of it. Nor indeed was this Condition added to his Oath, any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but rather ſerv'd to haſten the Ruin of <hi>Ras-Seelax.</hi> This Solemnity concluded with an Anathema, after the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> manner, upon all thoſe that for the future ſhould forget or break this Oath. Immediately after, ſeveral Edicts were Publiſh'd, <hi>That none for the future ſhould ſay Maſs, or Exerciſe the Priestly Office, except ſuch as were licens'd by the Patriarch.</hi> Thereupon, the Ordinations of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Metropolitan not being accompted lawful, moſt of the Prieſts were conſtrain'd to receive new Ordinations from the new Patriarch, upon this Condition, <hi>That they ſhould all obſerve the</hi> Roman <hi>Forms of Worſhip, and not give any ſuccour or harbour to Rebels; who offended in that Nature was to be ſeverely puniſh'd.</hi> It was alſo farther enjoyn'd that in the Celebration of <hi>Easter,</hi> and Obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> the Canons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be faithfully follow'd. There was alſo one thing more than uſual exacted by the Patriarch, who having a great miſtruſt of the Ladies of the Royal Blood, caus'd a <note place="bottom">It is ſtill a Proverb among the <hi>Ethiopians, Zaqon Qawino,</hi> What is done, let it be done.</note>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:59633:161"/>
Decree to be made, that they alſo upon a prefix'd day, as being more zealous for the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Opinions than the Men, ſhould take the Sacred Oath of Supremacy to the Pope, as if they had bin a diſtinct Body Politic from the Men. But whether it were put in Execution, or how done I do not find.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, great care was taken for Building a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Seat, and for ſettling an Annual Revenue for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Dignity of the new Primate; to which purpoſe a place was choſen out in the Confines of <hi>Bagemdra,</hi> and <hi>Dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bea,</hi> call'd <hi>Debſan;</hi> as alſo another in the Imperial Camp near <hi>Dancaz. Reſidencies</hi> alſo for the Fathers were built in ſeveral Provinces of the Empire to ſtock it with Jeſuits.</p>

                  <p>The ſame year alſo <hi>Lent</hi> was kept after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, with all the Solemnities of the Paſſion Week, as alſo <hi>Easter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar. Which occaſion'd moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commotions over all the Empire, and more eſpecially among the Clergy and Monks. Who being ignorant of the Computation and the Cauſe, thought it a high breach of the Canons of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> and the <hi>Paſchal Cycle</hi> therein preſcrib'd. Neither could the Edict be equally diſpers'd over ſo many far diſtant Regions for want of Printing.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time they were very buſie in Baptizing the Converted, and ordaining of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, many of which had bin already Baptiz'd and Ordain'd. Sermons were alſo Preach'd in ſeveral places after the manner of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> wherein it was neceſſary for the Fathers to Cite many places of Scripture, if they deſir'd to be accompted Learned.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:59633:162"/>
Thus the Fathers of the Society made a daily and very great Progreſs, inſomuch that the Number of Baptiz'd and Converted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion amounted to many Thouſands.</p>
                  <p>About two years after, the Patriarch made a Viſitation aſſiſted by ſome of the Sodality, in which vaſt Numbers of People were ſome of them Rebaptiz'd, others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd; to the great good-liking and applauſe of the King and his Peers, who had never ſeen ſuch things perform'd by any of their Metropolitans before. Others look'd aſquint upon theſe proſperous beginnings, ſeeking all Occaſions of new Diſturbances. Some there were that openly reſiſted, and would not permit any Prieſt under <hi>Roman</hi> Ordination to officiate in their Churches, nay ſome of them they kill'd out-right. As for the Countrey People, tho they were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively Obedient to the King's Commands, yet they lik'd their own old way beſt. Among the reſt there was one, who having receiv'd the Cuff of Confirmation, as their manner is, and being ask'd by his Neighbour how he did? <hi>Never worſe,</hi> ſaid He, <hi>than I have bin ſince I receiv'd the Patriarch's Box o'th' ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More than all this, there was a <hi>Seminary</hi> ſet up, for the Education as well of the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> as <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Children: for the Encouragement of whom, and to invite others, they caus'd ſome of the young Lads to Act a Comedy after the <hi>European</hi> manner. But when they brought in Devils upon the Stage, as the Scene requir'd, ſome of the ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, believing them real Hobgoblins, were ſo terrify'd, that they flung out of the School, crying out, <hi>Wajelan, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jelan, Sajetanet ametzea: O Dear! O Dear! they have brought us Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the enſuing Tragedies more terrify'd the wiſer ſort. For <hi>Tecla-George,</hi> another of the King's Sons in Law, for his Wives ſake, at difference with his Father, having drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Conſpiracy with him two Noblemen, <hi>Gebra-Marjam,</hi> and <hi>John Acayo,</hi> revolted openly, and by a Cryer ſolemnly proclaim'd, <hi>That he renounc'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Worſhip, and would Protect the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>by force of Arms.</hi> And that the world might believe he was in Earneſt, he caus'd all the Crucifixes, Roſaries, and other Ornaments of Popiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition to be burnt in a publick fire; and to the end there might be no hopes of Reconciliation left for the Expectation

of Confederates, he took his Chaplain <hi>Abba Jacob;</hi> who offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, and after he had diſpoyl'd him of his Stole and Hood, put him to Death.</p>
                  <p>The King could not brook ſo great an Indignity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent <hi>Kebax,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Tigra,</hi> with an Army againſt him, who us'd ſuch extraordinary Diligence, that he ſoon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd the ſecure and unprovided Rebel, overthrew his Army, and took him and his Siſter <hi>Adera</hi> Priſoners: who, becauſe they had ſo furiouſly and contemptuouſly acted againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, were both hang'd upon a high Tree. Nor could all the Interceſſions of the Queen, nor of all the Noble Ladies could prevail, tho they pleaded hard the diſgrace done to their Sex, and that it was never before known in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> that a Noblewoman was Hang'd: eſpecially being call'd by the King to behold ſo ſad and infamous a Spectacle. For they did not pity her becauſe they thought her Innocent, but for the Ignominy of her Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>After this follow'd ſeveral other Accidents, which as they brought a very great Odium upon the Patriarch and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo were they reckn'd to be the Cauſes of the general averſneſs of the People to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, that he might exerciſe all his Authority in one ſingle Act, and ſhew the full extent of his Power, having taken a pett againſt the Captain of the King's Guards, for ſome fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Buſineſs that nothing belong'd to his Juriſdiction, publickly in the Church, in the preſence of the whole Court, thunders out an Anathema againſt him, and ſent him Poſt to the Devil. It ſeems he had taken Poſſeſſion of certain Farms, which the Monks lay'd claim to, and refus'd to reſtore them, notwithſtanding all the Admonitions of the Patriarch. The Nobleman, tho a Soldier, hearing ſuch a moſt Dreadful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, by vertue whereof he was ſent packing to Hell, laden with all the Curſes of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> like one Thunder-ſtrook, fell into a Sound, and lay for Dead. But the Storm did not continue long: For preſently the King ſtept in to his relief, by whoſe interpoſition, and the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral of the Nobility, he was re-admitted into the ſtate of Grace. However it was an Act which the Nobility took moſt heinouſly to heart; among whom there were ſome that frown'd and chaf'd out of meer Indignation, to ſee that their Church ſhould be brought to ſuch a degree of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, that a Foreign Prieſt ſhould take upon him with ſo
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59633:163"/>
much Arrogance to Excommunicate and Bequeath to Eternal Damnation, one of the Chief Counſellors of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, an Ancient and Famous Perſonage, for the ſake of a Litigious Farm, which the King might take when he pleas'd from the Monks themſelves, if they were the Owners.</p>
                  <p>This Flame was fed by the addition of more fuel; For the <hi>Icegue</hi> or Chief Abbot of the Monks being at that time lately Deceas'd, who as we have already ſaid, is the next in Dignity and Authority to the <hi>Abuna,</hi> he was Buried in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Church, conſecrated after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, tho he had bin an obſtinate Zealot for the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion. Thereupon the Patriarch, after he had ſoundly reprov'd the Rector of the Church, <hi>Pronounc'd the Church profan'd by the Burial of a Heretic; and therefore that Maſs could not be ſaid in it.</hi> The Rector dreading the fatal ſtroak of the ſame diſmal <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> Thunderbolt, that lay'd the Great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſprawling, without expecting any new Command, cauſes the Carkaſs to be digg'd up again, and thrown by. This the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> heavily exclaim'd againſt, crying out, <hi>That the</hi> Franks <hi>exerciſed more cruel Severities upon them, then their moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated Enemies ever practis'd among them, to deprive their Dead of decent Burial: now they might all ſee what the Living were to expect. Tellez</hi> adds, That a certain old Woman was caſt into Priſon, upon Suſpition of being a Witch, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſet at liberty, becauſe it gave diſtaſte. For that the moſt Learned of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> are of Opinion, <hi>That there are now no more Magicians or Witches in the World; and therefore that the Woman was unjuſtly wrong'd, who was thrown into Priſon by the Command of the Patriarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Minds of the People being generally incens'd, the King himſelf began to look upon theſe acts of ſeparate Juriſdiction in the Patriarch, as Diminutions of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative (the ancient Metropolitans never daring to attempt ſuch things), and conſequently to alienate his Affections both from him and from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſo that at length he gave ear to their Adverſaries. Who to bring down and curb the Exceſſive Power of the Patriarch, which ſeem'd ſo into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to them, more eſpecially becauſe they found him ſtill inexorable in Matrimonial Cauſes, prohibited by Divine and Canon-Law; but chiefly in caſes of Polygamy and Divorce; they began their Addreſſes to him for thoſe things, which
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59633:163"/>
they knew he could not deny without bringing great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon himſelf. Firſt, <hi>That they might have liberty to ſay Maſs after the ancient</hi> Ethiopian <hi>manner; for that the Patriarch might mend the ancient forms, where Neceſsity requir'd, without abrogating the whole. That the People hearing their ancient Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, would be the more quiet, in regard they would not ſo much mind the difference between the New and the Ancient form of Worſhip.</hi> The Patriarch gave way to their deſires, only mending the Ethiopic Maſs, but with apparent Detriment to his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For now the ancient Liturgies were every day read again without Contradiction; the Report running abroad that the Emperor was return'd to the Old Religion. The Patriarch's Power thus ſhaken, the Courtiers ſtill whiſper'd in the King's Ears, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion was become odious to all the People, and that his Perſon would be in great Danger, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he alſo forſook it himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Inſinuations were back't by an Accident, which tho ridiculous in it ſelf, gave a <hi>being</hi> to ſeveral Rumors and Reports. For one day an Enthuſiaſt came into the Palace, and cry'd out, That he was ſent from God and the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Virgin, to declare in their own words to the <hi>King, that unleſs he forthwith return'd to the antient Religion, he ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Fortnight undergo moſt ſevere Chastiſements.</hi> The King made anſwer, <hi>That he would live and die in the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion:</hi> and that the Meſſenger might the more ſpeedily return his anſwer, <hi>Commanded him to be Hang'd.</hi> But at the Interceſſion of ſeveral who aſſerted the poor Fellow to be Frantick, he only receiv'd a ſevere drubbing, for the reward of his ſawcy Propheſie. Howevet tho he were laugh'd at by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, yet he ſo ſtrangely ſtirr'd the minds of the Vulgar, that they publickly reported, <hi>That an Angel had bin ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that he had admoniſh'd the King to return to the ancient</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Faith.</hi> In the mean while the inbred hatred againſt the Fathers daily increaſing, was greatly augmented by the envy of the Courtiers. For they incens'd the King and his Eldeſt Son againſt <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> the Fathers chief Friend, and Patron of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> under pretence of their great care, admonſhing the two Princes, <hi>To take heed that he did not abuſe the Renown he had won in War, and the favour of the</hi> Portugueſes, <hi>to invade the Royal Dignity.</hi> That which more heighten'd theſe growing Jealouſies, was a miſinterpreted act of <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> who having order'd one <hi>Lecanax</hi> to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59633:164"/>
for Calumnies and Scandalous Reports thrown upon himſelf, caus'd him afterwards to be put to Death, tho he had appeal'd to the King. This they ſaid was done by <hi>Seelax,</hi> not that the Perſon was guilty of the Crimes which were lay'd to his Charge, but to remove out of the way one that was Privy to the Treaſons and Conſpiracies of <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax.</hi> Whereupon the King depriv'd him inſtantly of great part of his Lands, remov'd him out of <hi>Gojam,</hi> and took from him his Military Commands.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, tho <hi>Tecla-George</hi> had ſuffer'd, and that the Heads of the Rebellion were taken off, yet the Rebellion it ſelf continu'd, and the ſtrength of it daily increas'd in ſuch manner, that it became the Original of Diſmal and Diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Commotions. For the <hi>Agawi,</hi> that inhabit the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Bagemdra,</hi> had not yet lay'd down their Arms; but being, as they pretended, more and more provok'd by-the King, kept them in their hands to revenge their Injuries. And the better to defend themſelves, they call'd to their Aid, one <hi>Melcax,</hi> a young Man of the Royal Blood, who had bin bred among the <hi>Gallans,</hi> and created him their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. To him therefore, as to a Sanctuary, flock'd all thoſe that bare any diſaffection to the King, all that hated the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion, eſpecially the Monks; and laſtly, ſeveral of the Villagers and Country People. All theſe thus embody'd, were call'd <hi>Laſteners,</hi> from <hi>Laſta,</hi> a moſt invincible Rock, and the chief Seat of the Rebellion. And indeed it ſeem'd a vaſt Torrent of War, ready to break forth to the utter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the Fathers, and all thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if it prov'd ſo kind to ſpare the Royal Family it ſelf. Againſt theſe therefore the King, having rais'd an Army of Seven and twenty Thouſand Men, marches himſelf in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but with ill ſucceſs at firſt. For the Country People, defended by the Security of the place, as the Royaliſts came on, ſtill beat them off, by rolling down whole Quarries at a time of ponderous Stones upon their heads, which having put the Royaliſts into great diſorder, they came down, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded all the King's Left Wing, ſo that had not <hi>Kebax</hi> come to their relief with 300 freſh Men, they had bin all cut to pieces. The Soldiers being diſcourag'd by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, the King who for that reaſon durſt not adventure any further for that time, left part of his Army to defend the Borders, and haſt'ning home, was forc'd to recall <hi>See-lax,</hi>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:59633:164"/>
lurking like an Exile in <hi>Gojam.</hi> In the mean time the Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Bands, whether for fear, or finding themſelves too weak, forſook their Poſts, ſo that the <hi>Laſtaneers</hi> ravag'd all the Country as they pleas'd, without Oppoſition, till <hi>Seelax</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got within their reach, drave them back into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Holes.</p>
                  <p>While this Rebellion rag'd in <hi>Bagemdra,</hi> another broke out in <hi>Amhara;</hi> being headed by <hi>Luca-Marjam,</hi> near in Blood to the Royal Family; but he being prevented and ſurpriz'd by the ſwift March of <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> ended his Days and his Deſign together, by falling from the Precipice of a Rock.</p>
                  <p>But the ſame good Fortune did not attend <hi>Kebax,</hi> who impatient of delay, and obſerving the Avenues more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently guarded than they us'd to be, the bait that betray'd him, conceiv'd no leſs than that <hi>Opportunity</hi> it ſelf had now proffer'd him the Victory. So in he marches, finding all clear before him for the preſent; but no ſooner was he in, when thoſe Mountaneers accuſtom'd to clamber their own Rocks, and us'd to the By-ways and conceal'd Paſſages of that Rock, were all on a ſudden before and behind him; ſo that after a great Slaughter of his Men, deſerted by the reſt, he was himſelf after a matchleſs defence, oppreſs'd by Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and Slain.</p>
                  <p>His, and the Fall of <hi>Tegur-Egzi,</hi> which ſoon after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, gave the Fathers no cauſe of Thankſgivings, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded their Enemies great Opportunities, and great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to preſs the King to withdraw his Favours from them. For obſerving their time, when they perceiv'd him ſad, and perplex'd at ſo much ill Succeſs, and ſo many Revolts, <hi>Oh Sir,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>What will be the Iſſue of all theſe Combats and pernicious Wars? Thoſe illiterate Swains underſtand not the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the</hi> Roman <hi>Worſhip, nor any other Service of God then what they have bin bred and brought up to. They call us</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Mahumetans, <hi>becauſe we have abandon'd our ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; for this reaſon they have taken Arms, and choſen to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Melcax,</hi> pufft up with the Succeſs of his Affairs, was arriv'd at that height of boldneſs, that nothing now would ſerve him but the aſſum'd Title of a King. He had diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted his Court-Employments after the manner of the Kings of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> among his Friends; and daily increas'd in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59633:165"/>
For all that abominated the <hi>Fathers,</hi> chiefly the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Tigra,</hi> privately gave him Encouragements, and exhorted him, <hi>not to deſiſt from what he had ſo proſperouſly begun; and that then, neither the Affections of the People, nor the Aſsiſtance of his Friends would be wanting.</hi> Elated with theſe golden Promiſes, his Temerity carry'd him ſo far, as to ſend, as if he had now bin the undoubted King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> a Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy into <hi>Tigra.</hi> To this Viceroy he allow'd a Select Band of Soldiers for his Convoy; but they, neglectful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of their Military Duties, took their Pleaſure ſo much, that at length ſurpriz'd in the midſt of their Jollity by the Royaliſts, they were forc'd to leave Four thouſand of their Party behind them, Slain upon the Spot; while the ſhatter'd Remainders ſpeeded back, to lay the blame of their ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs upon the unwary Conduct of their Leaders. But the <hi>Laſtaneers,</hi> intent upon revenge, had at length the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt the Royaliſts, who were ſtragling to deſtroy the approaching Harveſt, and pay'd them home with equal Slaughter for Slaughter. Thus Fortune ballancing both ſides, the Author of theſe Miſcarriages was enquir'd after, and as ſoon found by thoſe that watched their Opportunities. For preſently <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi> was accus'd, as if he had bin negligent in Executing the King's Orders, and had not ſent timely Succors to the over-power'd Combatants. And his Enemies ſo far prevail'd, that Articles were fram'd againſt him, to which he was compell'd to anſwer: which he did, and juſtify'd himſelf ſo well, that in words indeed he was acquitted, but in Fact condemn'd. For he was again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, and all his feudary Poſſeſſions and Military Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments granted away to <hi>Baſilides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi> being once more lay'd by, it was no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to undermine the Patriarch and the Fathers. For againſt them the general Complaint was made, <hi>That they had no other Deſign, but as they had ſubjected the Empire in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs to the</hi> Roman <hi>Pope, ſo to bring it under the Dominion of the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>in Seculars. To this end under the pretence of Temples and Reſidencies they rear'd up Caſtles and Walls, from whence they could never be expell'd with Spears and Arrows.</hi> Many other things of the ſame Nature, they ſuggeſted, which if the King now through Age more jealous, did not abſolutely believe, yet he hearken'd to them with a more eaſie Attention. However outwardly and publick he ſhew'd
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59633:165"/>
the ſame Kindneſs and Affability to the Fathers as before, and kindly receiv'd the Biſhop ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to be a Coadjutor to the Patriarch. But when he brought the <hi>Diploma</hi>'s of the Jubilee open'd at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1625. and then granted to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> he was derided by moſt Men, who could not comprehend thoſe great Vertues of Indulgencies which the Biſhop boaſted of. For ſome began to Diſcourſe among themſelves like the Phariſees, <hi>Who is this who alſo forgives Sins? Who can forgive Sins but only God?</hi> To which the King made anſwer with a ſevere Countenance, <hi>That the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven were given to</hi> Peter, <hi>and that the uſe of thoſe Keys belong'd to the Pope, for the Granting Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> as if thoſe Indulgencies had afforded Materials for Sin, bent themſelves ſtill more and more to Sedition and Tumult. For the Revolt of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaneers</hi> ſo well ſucceeding, <hi>Sertzazax,</hi> newly made Viceroy of <hi>Gojam,</hi> ſo ill repay'd the King for his new favours, that he not only revolted from him himſelf; but which was more deteſtable to think, he would have drawn in the young <hi>Baſilides</hi> to have conſpir'd with him againſt his own Father. And when he could not prevail upon the young Prince, he endeavour'd to have advanc'd another young Noble Gentleman of the Blood Royal, to the end he might have reign'd himſelf under his Name. But being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and taken, he was drubb'd to Death. Seven of his Accomplices loſt their Heads. One of his chief Agents, becauſe he had vented horrid Blaſphemies againſt the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and opprobrious words againſt the King, was hung up upon an Iron Hook driven into a high Stake; upon which, after he had hung a whole Day, becauſe he repeated the ſame Provocations in the midſt of his Torment, he was at length run thorough the Body with ſeveral Spears; and ſo ended his miſerable Life. So many, and ſuch lamentable Accidents as theſe pierc'd the very hearts of moſt People, and the <hi>Laſtaneers,</hi> diſpairing of Pardon, hearing of ſuch horrid Executions, were the more reſolute in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon the King undertook a new Expedition with all his Forces againſt them, and had taken the very Head and Ring-leader of all the Rebels, had he not with a ſmall Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue made a ſhift to Eſcape; yet he left behind him great
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59633:166"/>
ſtore of rich Plunder. But he could not be utterly Subdu'd, in regard that ſo many Sculking Holes, ſo many wide and ſpacious Rocks, where thoſe Savages liv'd and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, like ſo many wild Beaſts, could neither be aſſail'd nor taken. It happen'd therefore, that Fortune wheeling about, the Rebels overthrew a Select Party of the King's Forces: and by and by with all their force lay hovering about the King's Army, which they foreſaw would in a ſhort time want Proviſion. The King therefore fearing to be clos'd up in thoſe narrow Streights, retir'd into <hi>Dembea,</hi> before the War was at an end. Which he did with ſo much haſt more then it was thought he needed to have done, that as it diminiſh'd his own fame, ſo it gave Courage to the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>And now the Fathers great Enemies beholding the King's Melancholly, redoubled their Complaints. <hi>That there would never be peaceful Days in</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>ſo long as the</hi> Roman <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion bare ſo much ſway. That it was a very good Religion, but above the Capacity of the People, who would ſtill prefer the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their Anceſtors, to which they had bin bred from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, before foreign Innovations, which they underſtood not. For who ſhould perſwade them,</hi> That Circumciſion was evil, That the Holydaies of the Sabbath are not pleaſing to God; that the ancient Liturgy cannot be prov'd, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar is better then the <hi>Ethiopic;</hi> That the Faſts of the Fourth Holyday are leſs acceptable to God, then the Faſts of the Seventh? <hi>How much more expedient and profitable were it, to retain the ancient Ceremonies in ſuch things as do not contradict the Subſtance of Faith? But as for</hi> Ras-Seelax, <hi>and others that endeavour the Contrary, it was apparent they did it meerly to advance their own Deſigns againſt the King and Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With theſe and ſuch like Expoſtulations, the King being overcome, eſpecially finding no other way of appeaſing and quietting the <hi>Laſteneers,</hi> and that <hi>Bagemdra</hi> was almoſt all in the Hands of the Enemy, and at the ſame time all his Friends, eſpecially the Ladies of Quality laying before him the Danger he would be in, ſhould he be deſerted by his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he at length preſs'd the Patriarch, to remit whatever poſſibly might be remitted. He foreſeeing a terrible Storm, tho ſore againſt his Will, thought 'twas high time to lower his Sails, for fear of Loſing all, while he hazarded the Saving of all. Whereupon he ſubmitted to the King's requeſt; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59633:166"/>
upon Condition, <hi>That nothing Decreed ſhould be remitted by Publick Acts, but only by a Tacit Connivance, and that in the mean time there ſhould be a Ceſſation of all Penalties, and Mulcts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this the King intending a Third Expedition againſt the <hi>Laſteneers,</hi> to make his Soldiers the more ſtedfaſt and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, he put forth an Edict; by which, in general words an Indulgence was granted for the Exerciſe of all ancient Ceremonies, not repugnant to Faith. Thus every Perſon being left to his particular Liberty, the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Worſhip was again, to the great Satisfaction of the People, freely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd; but to the great grief of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> eſpecially the Patriarch, who preſently wrote to the King, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That contrary to his advice, a Lay Prince ſhould publiſh an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of that Nature in reference to ſpiritual Affairs:</hi> for that it belong'd to him to ſet forth ſuch Decrees; putting him in mind of the words of <hi>Azariah</hi> the High-Prieſt to King <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and of the Puniſhment that follow'd, and admoniſhing him to amend that Fault, by publiſhing ſome other Edict, which ſhould be propos'd by the aſſiſtance of ſome one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society. The King obey'd and propounded an Edict, which contain'd Three Articles.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>That the Ancient Liturgy, but Corrected, ſhould be read in the Maſs.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>That the Feſtivals ſhould be obſerv'd according to the ancient Computation of Time, except</hi> Eaſter, <hi>and thoſe other Feſtivals that depended upon it.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>That whoſoever pleas'd, inſtead of the Sabbath, might faſt upon the fourth Holyday.</hi> And then as for anſwer to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs Complaints, he made this reply, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was not introduc'd into his Dominions by the Preaching or Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Fathers, but meerly by his Edicts and Commands, not by the aſſent of his People, but of his own free will, becauſe he thought it better then the</hi> Alexandrian. <hi>Therefore the Patriarch had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Complain.</hi> But theſe Conceſſions not being ſufficient, and coming too late, prov'd altogether ineffectual; not ſerving in the leaſt to pacifie the <hi>Laſteneers,</hi> or any other of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Parties.</item>

                     <p>The Fathers ill Succeſs. The King prepares to reſtore the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Over-perſwaded by the Queen and his Son.

The Ancient Ceremonies us'd. An Invective Satyr againſt the Fathers. The ſudden Change cenſur'd.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WEE have hitherto ſeen the great Progreſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion in <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> the Authority of the Patriarch advanc'd to the utmoſt extent; the King and his Brothers, together with a great many of the Nobility, ſome ſincerely, ſome feignedly favouring the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. For the Latin Worſhip was with great diligence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and exercis'd all over ſeveral Provinces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Many of the <hi>Habeſsine</hi> Prieſts were Ordain'd by the Patriarch; and great diligence was us'd for the building of Churches and Colleges. Already beſides the Patriarch they had increas'd their Number to One and twenty Companions, that is to ſay, Nineteen Fathers, and Two Brothers of the Society, diſtributed into Thirteen Reſidencies. Nor could the Fathers but be well pleas'd with ſo many Thouſands of Baptized and Converted People; for certainly the gaining of ſo many loſt Souls by Baptiſm was not to be deſpiſed. When on a ſuddain behold a ſuddain Change, upon which the Baniſhment of the Fathers, and the Subverſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion enſu'd.</p>
                  <p>For the Fathers believing that the opportunity of the time was not to be neglected, made it their Buſineſs to abrogate all the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Rites, even thoſe which were formerly tolerated under the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops: on the other ſide, the Common People Wedded to their Old Cuſtoms; but more eſpecially the Monks and Clergy, the chief Supporters of the old Religion, moſt ſtoutly oppos'd their Proceedings. Beſides them, ſeveral of the Nobility, either out of Hatred
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59633:167"/>
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or out of Ambition, frequently revolted, and through the ſtrength of their unacceſſible Rocks eaſily eluded the King's more mighty Power. A moſt remarkable Leſſon to teach us, <hi>That that ſort of Worſhip to which the People are averſe, is not eaſily to be introduc'd by the Prince; and that it is no piece of Prudence or Policy to attempt the Liberty of thoſe who are well defended by the Situation of their Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the King, tho otherwiſe moſt addicted to the Fathers, wearied with ſo many Exclamations of his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, growing in years, utterly diſliking the preſent poſture of Affairs, and fearful of what might enſue, tormented with the continual Importunities of his Friends; his Jealouſie of his Brother, the Contumacy of the <hi>Laſteneers,</hi> the Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Prerogative, and the dread of loſing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, at length began to think of abrogating the <hi>Roman,</hi> and reſtoring the ancient <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Worſhip. And which was more to be admir'd, a proſperous Fight with the <hi>Laſteneers,</hi> was that which ſettled his wavering Thoughts. For making a fourth Expedition againſt them, he came upon them ſo unlook'd for, that he gave them a Total tout, Killing eight Thouſand upon the place, with ſeveral of the Leaders of the Faction, and chief Deſerters of their King and Country. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> rejoyc'd at the News, believing the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion quietted by this Victory; and that for the future nothing would preſume ſo much as to hiſs againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. But it fell out quite otherwiſe. For they who favour'd the the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion, the next day carry'd the King to view the Field of the Battel, and ſhewing him the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Slain, thus beſpake him. <hi>Neither</hi> Ethnics <hi>nor</hi> Mahumetans <hi>were theſe, in whoſe Slaughter we might have ſome reaſon to rejoyce. No, Sir, they were Chriſtians, once your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and our dear Countrymen; and partly to your ſelf, partly to us related in Blood. How much more laudable would it have bin for theſe couragious Breaſts to have bin oppos'd againſt the moſt deadly of your Enemies? This is no Victory, becauſe obtain'd againſt your own Subjects. With the ſame Sword wherewith you Slaughter them, you Stab your own Bowels: Certainly they bare no hatred to us, whom we make War upon ſo cruelly. Only they are a verſe to that Worſhip to which you would compel them. How many have we already kill'd upon this Change of Ceremonies? How many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main behind reſerv'd for the ſame Slaughter? When will theſe Bloody Conflicts end? Forbear, we beſeech your Majeſty, to conſtrain them
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59633:168"/>
to Novelties, and Innovations, leſt they renounce their Allegiance: otherwiſe we ſhall never behold the Face of Peace again. We are hated even by the</hi> Gallans <hi>and</hi> Ethnicks <hi>for abandoning our ancient Ceremonies, and are therefore by them call'd Apoſtates.</hi> For it ſeems that the King of <hi>Adel,</hi> having apprehended and put to Death two of the <hi>Fathers</hi> travelling into <hi>Habeſsinia</hi> thorow his Country, in the accompt which he gave to <hi>Suſneus</hi> of what he had done, haughtily call'd him Apoſtate. Nor is it to be queſtion'd but that the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations were much Scandaliz'd at the Alteration of the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> into the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; not out of any love to the one, or hatred to the other; but for fear the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> ſtrengthen'd by the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> ſhould become their Maſters. The <hi>Turks</hi> alſo were mad that the Metropolitan of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was no more to be ſent for out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for by that ſame Tye they held the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> faſt, and lyable to what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>To theſe inceſſant Importunities, the Queen joyn'd the pow'rful Charms of her own Supplication, conjuring him by all the Obligations of Sacred Wedlock, and common Pledges of their undoubted Offspring, <hi>To be well adviſed what he did; and not to ruin his Kingdom, Himſelf, his Fortune, and his whole Family.</hi> With the ſame importunity his Eldeſt Son <hi>Baſilides,</hi> and his Brother by the Mothers ſide <hi>Jamanax,</hi> hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſollicited his diſturb'd mind: and the better to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their ends, they underhand procur'd the <hi>Gallans</hi> that ſerv'd the King, to deſire a diſmiſſion, as being unwilling to fight any longer againſt the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> in a quarrel about a new Religion. Thus the King's rigor mollify'd at length, <hi>Baſilides,</hi> after he had ſummon'd the Nobility and chiefeſt of his Father's Counſellors together, held a Council, wherein it was concluded, That there was no other remedy to allay the Diſorders of the Kingdom, but by reſtoring the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion. And the better to perſwade thoſe that were of the Contrary Opinion, they gave it out that the <hi>Romanists</hi> and <hi>Alexandrians</hi> were of the ſame Opinion in points of Faith; That both affirm'd that God was true Chriſt, and true Man. And as for the aſſerting One or Two Natures, they were only words of little Moment, and not worth the Ruin of a Mighty Empire. So that the King induc'd by theſe reaſons, gave liberty to every one that pleas'd to return to the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> Forms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:59633:168"/>The Patriarch was not ignorant of theſe Tranſactions. Whereupon being accompanied with his Coadjutor, &amp; the chief of the Fathers, he deſir'd Audience of the King. Which being granted, after a ſhort Pauſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid He, <hi>I had thought that we had lately bin the Victors, but now I ſee we are Vanquiſh'd: On the other ſide the</hi> Laſteneers, <hi>being overthrown and put to flight, have obtain'd their deſires. Before the Battel was fought 'twas then a time to Vow and Promiſe, but now to fulfil. The Victory was gain'd by the Catholic and</hi> Portugueſe <hi>Soldiers, the God of Hoſts fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Catholic Religion. Theſe are therefore but ill returns to his Divinity; For I underſtand, here has bin a Decree made, giving free toleration again of the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Religion. But this is not a place I ſee to adviſe with Biſhops and Religious Perſons; the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Vulgar, the</hi> Gallans <hi>and</hi> Mahumetans, <hi>Women here give their Judgments in Matters of Religion. Conſider how many Victories you have gain'd from the Rebels, ſince you have embrac'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion: Remember, that you embrac'd it, not compell'd by force or fear, but of your own free choice, as believing it the Truer. Neither did we come hither as Intruders; we were ſent hither, by the Pope and the King of</hi> Portugal <hi>at your request. Neither did they ever deſign any other thing in their thoughts, but only to unite your Empire to the Church of</hi> Rome. <hi>And therefore beware of exciting their juſt Indignation. They are 'tis true far diſtant hence; but God is at hand, and will require the Satisfaction which is due to them. You will throw an indelible blemiſh upon the Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Juda, <hi>which you bear for your Atchievement; You will blur your own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, and the Glory of your Nation: Laſtly, you will be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted occaſion of innumerable Sins by y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The King not any way concern'd, reply'd in few words, <hi>That he had done as much as he could, but could do no more, neither was a total alteration of Religion intended, but only a Conceſsion of ſome Ceremonies.</hi> To which the Patriarch anſwer'd, <hi>That he had already tolerated ſome, and was ready to indulge more, which did not concern the Subſtance of Faith: So that he would put forth another Edict, that all things might remain as they were.</hi> To which he receiv'd no other reply, but <hi>That the King would ſend certain Commiſsioners to Treat and Diſcourſe with the Fathers.</hi> Nor had they a better anſwer from the Prince, who being an Artiſt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59633:169"/>
at Diſſimulation, ſent them away unſatisfy'd, with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous words.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> The favourers of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion, to the end they might get the Decree already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd put in Execution, Addreſs themſelves to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and chooſing <hi>Abba-Athanaſius</hi> for their Prolocutor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him, <hi>That he would by a Publick Edict be pleas'd to give his Subjects Liberty to return to the Religion of their Anceſtors; that otherwiſe the Kingdom would be utterly ruin'd.</hi> The King aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and order'd certain Commiſſioners to ſignifie his Pleaſure to the Patriarch. They preſently fell ſharply to work with him, and upbraided him, <hi>with the frequent Rebellions of the People;</hi> Aelius, Cabrael, Tecla-George, <hi>and</hi> Sertzac, <hi>and with the Slaughter of ſo many Thouſands as fell with them. That the</hi> Laſteneers <hi>were ſtill in Arms for their ancient Religion; that all ran to them, and deſerted the King, becauſe all the</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſines <hi>pin'd after their ancient Religion. However, that for the future it ſhould be free for every one to be at his own choice which to follow: for ſo from the Time of</hi> Claudius <hi>till lately, there had bin Peace and Quietneſs between different Opinions, while the</hi> Portugueſes <hi>exercis'd theirs, the</hi> Habeſſines <hi>their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a ſhort time of Deliberation, an Anſwer was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd back to the King by Father <hi>Emanuel D' Almeyda; That the Patriarch understood that the Exerciſe of both Religions would be free in his Kingdom. That for his part he had an equal love for</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>as for his own Native Country; and therefore for his part he was ready to grant whatſoever might be done, with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Purity of ſound Doctrine. But that there was ſtill a difference to be made between thoſe who had not yet embrac'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, as the</hi> Laſteneers, <hi>for that they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd at; but they who had poſitively embrac'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, and had bin admitted to Confeſsion and the Sacraments, no indulgence could be granted to them, without committing a great Sin, to return to the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Temperament the Patriarch deſign'd to have put a Bar upon the King and all the Court, which had already publickly made Profeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ceremonies. But the King, almoſt ſpent with Vexation and Grief, made no other anſwer than this: <hi>How can this be done? I am now no more Lord of my own Kingdom.</hi> So they were forc'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part as they came. Preſently the Drums beat, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59633:169"/>
ſounded, and Proclamation was made by the Voice of the Cryer. <hi>O yez, O yez; In the first place we propounded to ye, the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, eſteeming it the beſt. But an innumerable multitude of Men, have periſh'd through diſlike of it with</hi> Aelius, Cabriel, Tecla-George, Sertzac, <hi>and laſtly, with the Ruſtick</hi> Laſtaneers. <hi>And therefore we grant you the free Exerciſe of the Religion of your Anceſtors. It ſhall be lawful for you hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to frequent your own Churches, make uſe of your own Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtic Arks, and to read the Liturgies after the old Cuſtom. So fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well and Rejoyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a thing almoſt impoſſible to be believ'd with what an Univerſal Joy this Edict was receiv'd among the People. The whole Camp, as if they had had ſome great Deliverance from the Enemy, rang with Shouts and Acclamations. The Monks and Clergy, who had felt the greateſt weight of the Fathers Hatred lifted up their Thankful voices to Heaven. The promiſcuous Multitude of Men and Women danc'd and caper'd; The Soldiers wiſh'd all happineſs to their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: They brake to pieces their own and the Roſaries of all they met, and ſome they burnt. Crying out, that it was ſufficient for them to believe, That Chriſt was true God and true Man, without the unneceſſary Diſputes concerning the two Natures. From thenceforward the old Ceremonies were made uſe of in the Communion; Grapeſtone Liquor inſtead of Wine. And the Holy Name of Jeſus forbidden to be ſo frequent in their Mouths, after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner; and ſome that did not obſerve this Caution, they ran through with their Lances. Some few days after, a general Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was appointed, not minding the pain of ſuch a piece of Vanity, ſo they might not be thought to have neglected any thing of their ancient Rites in favour of the Fathers. Some there were alſo that us'd the ancient manner of waſhing themſelves upon the Feſtival of the Epiphany, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving themſelves thereby purify'd from the guilt of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>Others ran about Singing for joy that <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was deliver'd from the <hi>Western Lyons,</hi> Chanting forth the following Lines.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>At length the Sheep of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> free'd</l>
                     <l>From the Bold Lyons of the West,</l>
                     <l>Securely in their Pastures feed,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:59633:170"/>St. <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Doctrine have o'recome</l>
                     <l>The Folly's of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <l>No more the Western Wolves</l>
                     <l>Our <hi>Ethiopia</hi> ſhall enthrall.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And thus fell the whole Fabrick of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, that had bin ſo long rearing with ſo much Labour and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and which had coſt the Effuſion of ſo much Blood to pull it down. So vaſt and haughty Tow'rs that have bin long time Built, if once you undermine the Foundation, tumble in a moment. Some there were who accus'd the Fathers of the Society, as if they had ruin'd the fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs they had made by double Diligence, and over-haſty Zeal. For moſt of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> and many of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſsines</hi> themſelves that were well affected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion took it ill, that things ſhould be ſo ſuddainly chang'd, which might have bin longer let alone, without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to fundamental Faith. For as tall Trees, that have taken deep root, are not eaſily Eradicated, ſo inveterated Opinions, which we have as it were ſuck't in with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Milk are not to be overcome but by length of time, great Lenity, and much Patience. For Humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if compell'd, puts on Obſtinacy as it were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of injur'd Liberty. Nor did ſome that were the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers great Friends make any Queſtion, that had they left ſome things indifferent, which the Pope himſelf many times freely tolerates, ſo it be acknowledg'd as the Act of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and Diſpenſation, as the Computations of the holy Times, the Communion under both Kinds, and ſome other things which the Primitive Church without any Scandal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated and permitted, as the Marriage of Prieſts, the Faſt of the fourth Holyday, the Obſervation of the Sabbath, and ſome other things which depended meerly upon Cuſtom, and not upon Divine Precept, and had only minded in the mean time the Buſineſs of Converſion and Preaching, they had gain'd not only the <hi>Habeſsines,</hi> but the Pagans themſelves, and working by degrees, had brought their deſign at length to perfection. But they relying wholly upon the Favour and Succeſſes of the King were preſently for compelling the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſsines</hi> to conform of a ſuddain in all things to a ſtrange and uncouth Innovation. The Latin Tongue muſt be us'd in
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59633:170"/>
their Publick Sacred Worſhip, and their daily Prayers, the Angelical Salutation, the Lord's Prayer and the Apoſtolic Creed muſt be ſaid in Latin, written in the Ethiopic Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, in which <hi>Eve Maria grazia Plena,</hi> &amp;c. ſounded ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and odly to the <hi>Habeſsinian</hi> Pronunciation. Which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſo alienated the Affections of the <hi>Habeſsinians</hi> from ſuch a ſort of aukward Devotion, ſo that at length all the Wars, Seditions, Peſts of Locuſts, Famine, and all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that follow'd, and the ſevere Penalties that were inflicted upon the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> were lay'd upon the <hi>Fathers;</hi> which begat them Hatred inſtead of Reverence, and Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the room of Favour and Affection.</p>
                  <p>From what has bin ſaid, Men of Prudence will eaſily find the cauſes of ſo great a Mutation. Nevertheleſs it will not be improper to add thoſe other which <hi>Tellez.</hi> has aſſign'd.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he ſays, That the ſtrict Tyes and Laws of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony according to the Catholic Faith, were not ſo well brook'd by the <hi>Habeſsinians,</hi> being allow'd by the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian</hi> Religion, to Marry one or more, and to Divorce, as they ſaw good.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That beſides Incontinency, Avarice, Ambition, Envy, Hatred had got a head among them, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> whoſe Power they could find no better way to pull down, than by Perſecuting the <hi>Fathers;</hi> for whom he had ſo indear'd a Kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That many were poſſeſs'd of the Church Lands, of which they were unwilling to make reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the Secular Judges complain'd that the Patriarch ſummon'd all Matrimonial Cauſes to his Tribunal.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That others were enrag'd to ſee Churches built with Lime and Stone; for they call'd them Caſtles, not Churches, built by <hi>Ras-Seelax,</hi> to the end he might make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, That the Monks were incens'd, to ſee the Fathers only in Eſteem, and themſelves formerly ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverenc'd, afterwards contemn'd and ſlighted; ſo
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59633:171"/>
that as the other grew great, they ſhould become nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> always appeal'd to the Manners and Rites of their Anceſtors, not believing it to be juſt, to condemn them of Error, who had bin accompted Holy Men for ſo many Ages; or to hear and follow Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, neglecting the Laws and Cuſtoms of their Fore-fathers. For through the vitiouſneſs of Humane Malignity, ſaith <hi>Quintilian,</hi> Old things are always applauded, Novelties held to be loathſome. So that although you overcome the reaſon by Argument, you can never ſubdue the Will.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, That the Devil had put it into the Heads of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Catholicks to make a correſponding Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Catholick and the <hi>Alexandrinian</hi> Religion; aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to be Chriſtians, as well <hi>Alexandrians</hi> as <hi>Romans.</hi> That all believe in Chriſt; That Chriſt ſaves all; That there is little Difference between both Religions; That both have Conveniencies and Inconveniencies, their Truths and their Errors, but that the Wheat was to be ſeparated from the Cockle.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, That the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures ſeem'd very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the <hi>Habeſsines;</hi> eſpecially when they heard the Patriarch name <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> in the Excommunication.</p>

Their Churches taken from them. <hi>Suſneus</hi> Dyes. <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi> renouncing the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion is Overthrown and Baniſh'd. Others put to Death.

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFter the Publication of the King's Edict, the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrians</hi> being now abſolute Victors, endeavour'd with all their induſtry to be quit with the Fathers, and expel them quite out of <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> To which purpoſe they omitted no occaſion of daily quarrel and contention: Firſt accuſing the Patriarch for endeavouring by Seditious Sermons to ſtir up the People to Sedition, and to turn them from the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion; for that he had openly exhorted his Hearers to <hi>Conſtancy.</hi> But underſtanding that <hi>Baſilides</hi> was diſpleas'd, and gave out threatning words, they thought it requiſite to act more moderately. Soon after the <hi>Fathers</hi> Churches were taken from them, believing that would be a means to put a ſtop to the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip. And firſt they were conſtrain'd to quit their Cathedral at <hi>Gorgora,</hi> a ſtately Structure after the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> manner. At their departure they carry'd with them all their Sacred Furniture, brake all the Sculpture, and ſpoil'd the Pictures, that they might not leave them to be the ſport of their Adverſaries: doing that themſelves, which they thought the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> would do. And this Example they follow'd in all other places from whence they were expell'd. In the mid'ſt of theſe Tranſactions, <hi>Suſnèus</hi>'s Diſtemper increaſing, and more and more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by his continual anguiſh of Mind, he ended this Life the 16th day of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1632.</p>

                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:59633:172"/>The King being Dead, the Fathers Adverſaries ſet upon <hi>Ras-Seelax</hi> in the firſt place, as the Principal Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and Protector of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion: and firſt of all they promiſe him all his former Dignities, all his Poſſeſſions and Goods, upon Condition he would return to the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion. Upon his refuſal, they bring him bound in Chains before the King, and pronounce him guilty of Death. But the King declaring that he would not pollute his hands with the Blood of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, commanded him to be carry'd to a certain remote Place, near to <hi>Samenar,</hi> and ſequeſter'd his Goods. And as he was great, ſo was he attended in his fall by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, as <hi>Atzai-Tino,</hi> Secretary of State, and the King's Hiſtoriographer, <hi>Walata Georgiſſa,</hi> the Queens Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. In ſhort, whoever had favour'd the Fathers, were all ſent into Exile, and ſome put to Death, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had bin more bitter in their Expreſſions than others againſt the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion. For ſome had call'd it, <hi>a Religion for Dogs.</hi> After all this the Enemies of the Fathers ſtill inſiſted, <hi>That nothing was yet done, ſo long as the Patriarch and the Fathers were ſuffer'd to abide within the Confines of the Kingdom: Neither would the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaneers <hi>be quiet till they heard the Fathers were all thrown out of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>but would look upon all things tranſacted for the re-eſtabliſhment of the</hi> Alexandrian <hi>Religion as fictitious Stories.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There needed not many words to preſs him that was already willing. Firſt of all therefore, their Goods and Poſſeſſions were taken from them; then all their Arms, eſpecially their Muſquets and Fire-Arms. But before that, they were ſent to <hi>Fremona,</hi> where, as we have already declar'd, <hi>Oviedo</hi> the Patriarch reſided for ſome time. But before their Departure, the Patriarch wrote a certain Letter to the King, to this Effect:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I did not adventure to come into</hi> Habeſſinia <hi>with my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, of my own accord, but by the Command of the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontiff, and the King of</hi> Portugal, <hi>at the request of your Father, where having taken the King's Oath of Obedience, I officiated the Office of Patriarch in the Name of the</hi> Roman <hi>Pontiff, and the King of</hi> Portugal. <hi>Now becauſe you Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:59633:172"/>
me to depart, my humble requeſt is, that your Majeſty would ſet down the Cauſes of my Exilement in Writing, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd with your own, and the hands of ſome of your Counſellors and Peers, that all the World may know whether I am compell'd to ſuffer for my Life and Converſation, or for the ſake of my Doctrine. I granted the Ceremonies deſired by your Father, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Communion under both Kinds, which only the Pope himſelf can diſpute with. The ſame alſo I again offer, ſo that you and your Subjects will yield Obedience to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>as the head of all other Churches. My last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is, That as the Matter was Debated at first, ſo it may be referr'd to another Diſpute; by which means the Truth of the whole affair will more manifeſtly appear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Writing the King thus reply'd, <hi>Whatever was done by me before, was done by the Command of my Father, whom I was in Duty bound to Obey; ſo that I was forc'd to wage War under his Conduct, both with Kindred and Subjects. But after the laſt Battel of</hi> Wainadega <hi>the Learned and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Clergy and Layety, Civil and Military, young and old, all ſorts of Perſons made their Addreſſes to my Father, Crying out,</hi> How long ſhall we be perplexed and wearied with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable things? How long ſhall we encounter Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Kindred, cutting off the right hand with the left? How long ſhall we thruſt our Swords into our own Bowels? Eſpecially ſince we learn nothing from the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion but what we knew before. For what the <hi>Romans</hi> call the two Natures in Chriſt, his Divinity and his Humanity, that we knew from the beginning to this time. For we all believe that our Lord Chriſt is perfect God and perfect Man; perfect God in his Divinity, and perfect Man in his Humanity. But in regard thoſe Natures are not ſeparated nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; for neither of them ſubſiſt of its ſelf, but both of them conjoyn'd the one with the other; therefore we do not ſay that they are two things. For one is made two, yet ſo as the Natures are not mix'd in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. <hi>This Controverſie therefore among us is of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; neither was it for this that there has bin ſo much Bloodſhed among us, but chiefly becauſe the Blood was deny'd to the Layety, whereas Chriſt has ſaid in his Goſpel,</hi> Unleſs ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59633:173"/>
ye ſhall not have life everlaſting; <hi>and when he inſtituted the Holy Supper, he did not ſay, The Blood is in my Body, which I have given to you alone; but take and drink, and partake all. From that time the Diſciples did as they were commanded. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſsion of the Faſt of the fourth Holyday, which is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enjoyn'd by the Canons of the Holy Apoſtles: as alſo a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner of Faſting in the Time of</hi> Lent. <hi>Beſides by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Order of the whole Eccleſiaſtical Computation in reference to the Annual Feſtivals, and the Permiſsion of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to enter into the Church, without any diſtinction of clean or unclean; theſe are the things that gave offence to our People. But they deteſted nothing more, than the reiteration of Baptiſm, as if we had bin Heathens, before we had bin Baptiz'd by the Fathers. They re-ordain'd our Prieſts and Deacons, they burnt the wooden Cheſts of our Altars, and Conſecrated ſome Altars of their own, as if ours had not bin Conſecrated before. The Monks alſo complain'd, that their Inſtitutions were abrogated. Theſe and others of the ſame Nature were the true Cauſes, that we abandon'd the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, tho it was not we who gave it Protection but our Father. And therefore, becauſe the</hi> Alexandrian Abuna <hi>is now upon his Journey hither, and hath ſent us word, that he cannot live or joyntly act in the ſame Kingdom with the</hi> Roman <hi>Patriarch, and the Fathers, we command you to haſten to</hi> Fremona. <hi>Thoſe things are offer'd now too late, which might have bin eaſily at firſt allow'd: For now there is no return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, which all the whole Nation abhors and deteſts: for which reaſon, all farther Colloquies and Diſputes will be in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Patriarch relates in his Epiſtle to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> That that ſame Metropolitan, of whom the King makes mention, came ſome years before into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> but lay pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately conceal'd in <hi>Enarea,</hi> where hearing of the diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and caſting off the Patriarch, he brake out into this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expreſſion, to the King, <hi>That he could not officiate in his Office, unleſs the Patriarch and the Fathers were either put to Death, or Baniſh'd to perpetuity.</hi> So that the Patriarch and the Fathers were forc'd to obey the King's Command, not without a long Diſpute about their Guns, which they would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have kept for their own Preſervation; but they were forc'd to deliver them up, that they might be of no uſe to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who were coming, as it was fear'd and report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to their aſſiſtance. Thus the Patriarch with all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were then in the Country, were conſtrain'd to leave
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59633:173"/>
their warm Seats after an Enjoyment of Eight years ſtanding. In their return they met with various Misfortunes, and were frequently infeſted with Thieves, before they could get to <hi>Fremona.</hi> But becauſe they foreſaw, that would be no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place for'em of any long continuance, they preſently reſolv'd to ſend away ſome of the Fathers before into <hi>India,</hi> to give the Vice-Roy an accompt of the ſtate of their affairs, and to deſire ſome remedy, that is to ſay, a good ſufficient ſtrength of <hi>Portugueſis.</hi> But before they could obtain that, they receiv'd freſh Commands from the King (who 'tis very probable ſmelt their Deſign) to remove from <hi>Fremona</hi> and be gon. But they ſang loath to depart a great while, and to ſpin out time, privately retir'd to one <hi>John Akay,</hi> formerly an Enemy to the King, who not being able to defend them, they were pull'd out thence by the Ears, and in <hi>May</hi> 1634. deliver'd to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and firſt carry'd to <hi>Arkiko</hi> and <hi>Matzua,</hi> after that to <hi>Suaqena,</hi> and brought beore the <hi>Turkiſh Baſha.</hi> And indeed there was nothing more that provok'd the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſsines,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> told me, then that they ſhould require aid of the Military Power from <hi>India</hi> to eſtabliſh their Religion: <hi>They might,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>have ſhaken the duſt from their ſhoes at their departure, as the Apoſtles were commanded; but they were for ſettling Religion with Swords and Guns.</hi> Which was not done ſo ſecretly but it came to the Ears of the <hi>Habeſsines;</hi> for it ſeems that ſome of their Train, vext at ſome Misfortune or other, had imprudently threaten'd it. Which was one reaſon among others that their Churches built of Stone and Morter, and their Guns were taken from them.</p>

                     <p>The Condition of the Biſhop and his Aſſociates privately left behind. The Patriarchs miſery among the <hi>Turks.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOtwithſtanding the King's Commands to all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Patriarch left behind privately in ſeveral places <hi>Apollinaris Almeyda, Hiacynthos Franciſco, Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigo Cordeyra, Bruno Bruni</hi> and ſome others, who after they had liv'd miſerably for ſome time, lurking up and down, at laſt were moſt of them Hang'd. In the mean time he himſelf ſpent almoſt a whole year in great Vexation, and full of ſorrow among the Barbarous <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Suaqena,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt melted by the Sun. But nothing more increas'd the anguiſh of his Mind, than the News of the New Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan's arrival out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that it ſhould be his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be conſtrain'd to behold him as he paſs'd by. He had in his Train a certain <hi>German,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Peter Heyling,</hi> a Native of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> a young Gentleman emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Probity and Learning, a Profeſſor of the <hi>Augustan,</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion, and generally call'd by the Title of <hi>Muallim,</hi> that is in Arabic, <hi>Doctor Peter.</hi> He being deſirous to ſee the world, and learn the Arabic Language, was arriv'd about that time in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was very much eſteem'd for his Piety and Modeſty by the <hi>Coptites,</hi> and hearing that the Metropolitan was going for <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> he obtain'd leave to go in his Train, and by that means met the Patriarch <hi>Alphonſus</hi> at <hi>Suaqene.</hi> Preſently he undertook to encounter him, oppoſing ſeveral Opinions and Tenents of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and expounding in Arabic to the ſtanders by, whatever was ſaid on both ſides. The Patriarch in a heat
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59633:174"/>
deſir'd him to forbear that Explanation, becauſe he did not underſtand the Arabic. To which the other anſwer'd, That he Diſputed, for others to hear as well as himſelf. The Diſputation being ended, The Patriarch, turning to his Companions, ſighing, told them, <hi>That if that Doctor went into</hi> Habeſſinia, <hi>he would precipitate the whole Country into Hereſie.</hi> He was no ſooner arriv'd there, but he became very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the King, who gave him a Tent, and all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Concerning his Death, various Reports were ſpread abroad. For ſome ſaid, That being moſt graciouſly and kindly entertain'd by the King, he dy'd in <hi>Habeſsinia:</hi> Others, that being honourably diſmiſs'd by the King, he was murder'd by certain Arabian Thieves.</p>
                  <p>As for the Patriarch, after a long Captivity and very bad Uſage from the <hi>Turks,</hi> he was at length ſet at Liberty, after he had pay'd for himſelf and his Companions a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of 4000 <hi>German</hi> Dolars, and ſo at length got ſafe to <hi>Goa.</hi> Where, tho he were advis'd to go himſelf into <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gual,</hi> and give an accompt of the afflicted State of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> he thought it the better way to ſend <hi>Jeronymo Lobo,</hi> with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deſire the Aid of a ſufficient Military Power, to reſtore him to his loſt See. Thereupon the diligent Jeſuit, not only went into <hi>Portugal,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Mantua</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, and from thence to <hi>Rome.</hi> But all his Negotiations prov'd ineffectual; whether it were that they did not think it at that inſtant ſo Apoſtolical a way to propagate the Goſpel by force of Arms; or whether it were that they did not like the Charge of an Expedition, from whence they could hope for little good, there being no conſiderable Party in the Kingdom to give them footing, and the encouragement of Aſſiſtance. For the King watchful over all caſualties, put all to Death that favour'd the <hi>Roman Fathers.</hi> Which occaſion'd the Ruin of many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; among the reſt <hi>Tecla-Selax;</hi> and ſeveral Prieſts that had taken <hi>Roman</hi> Orders; and all the Fathers, except <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Nogueyra,</hi> whom the Patriarch had created his Vicar. For tho the Patriarch attempted afterwards to ſend ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Fathers, yet all their Endeavours were in vain; ſo that for a long time he could learn no News concerning the State of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs in <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> For the King fearing leſt the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſhould invade his Dominions in revenge of the Fathers, had brib'd the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Baſha's of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59633:175"/>
                     <hi>Suaqena</hi> and <hi>Matzua,</hi> willing enough to that of themſelves, not to admit entrance to any of the <hi>Franks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The News of which coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Minds of men were variouſly affected. The greateſt part were ſorry that all their fair hopes of retaining <hi>Ethiopia</hi> in Pontifical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were quite cut off. Others blam'd the Fathers of the Society, that through their Arrogance and Imprudence in managing the Temper and Diſpoſition of the <hi>Habeſsines;</hi> they had ruin'd both themſelves and the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; whereas they ought to have made it their Buſineſs to have acted chiefly and in the firſt place for the Majeſty, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope over the Univerſal Church, and willingly to have ſuffer'd all Miſeries, and Martyrdoms, rather than have quitted their Station. <hi>Tellez</hi> involves theſe particulars in a general Relation, ſaying, That ſeveral Malevolent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were ſpread about in <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſome there were who gave out, That the <hi>Fathers,</hi> out of meer deteſtation of their Perſons, and hatred of the whole Nation of <hi>Portugal</hi> were ejected out of <hi>Habeſsinia:</hi> and that if other Preachers were ſent, the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> would willingly embrace both them and their Doctrine. Which was a thing to be done with much leſs Expence, and more probable to come to effect than <hi>Lobo</hi>'s Project of ſending an Army.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Congregation for propagating the Faith,</hi> took another Courſe, and ſent Six <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fryers, all <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> with Letters of Recommendation and ſafe Conduct from the Emperor of the <hi>Turks</hi> himſelf, with Orders to try what they could do in <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> Two of theſe going by Sea, landed at <hi>Magadoſo,</hi> ſeated upon the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>Africa;</hi> but before they could get many Leagues up into the Countrey, they were knock't o'the head by the Cafers. Two of them got as far as the Confines of <hi>Habeſsinia;</hi> but being diſcover'd, they were preſently Commanded either to return back, or make Profeſſion of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion; and upon their refuſal to do either, were preſently ſton'd to Death. Of which, when the other two that ſtay'd at <hi>Matzua</hi> had notice, they rather choſe to return home again than ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to no purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>At length alſo <hi>Bernard Nogueira</hi> was apprehended, the laſt of all the Fathers, and fairly Hang'd. As for the Patriarch <hi>Mendez,</hi> he liv'd in <hi>India</hi> till the year 1656. Where in the 22d of his Exile, and the 77th of his Age he dy'd upon the 29 day of <hi>January.</hi> He was endu'd with moſt accompliſh'd gifts both of Body and Mind, very Tall, and of a firm Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Body, well read both in the Greek and Latin, and every way fitted for his Employment. Neither had he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prudence, had not the King's Favour and Succeſs which oftentimes intoxicate the Wiſeſt of Men, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him out of the way to act with that violence and ſeverity where gentleneſs and caution were ſo requiſite. By which means, inſtead of gaining, he was forc'd to ſuffer the ſhameful detriment of that Authority, which he had too far extended. Others, as <hi>Gregory</hi> told me, excus'd him, for that upon his arrival he found things ſo far driven on by the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, that he could not with Honour recede from what they had done. Since the Death of the Patriarch we have had no certain Relations out of <hi>Habeſsinia.</hi> In the year 1652. a new Metropolitan was ſent into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> who had bin ſeen by many <hi>Europeans</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was ſucceeded afterwards by ſeveral others, as we have gather'd from certain Relation. From whence we may infer, That the report of <hi>Tellez</hi> was a thing fram'd out of Envy; as if the King of the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> had ſent his Ambaſſadors into <hi>Arabia,</hi> to deſire thence Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Doctors, with an intention to embrace Turciſm, which no man can think probable, from what has bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy related. For how is it likely that he who could not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the ſplendid Religion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctrines of the Fathers, becauſe they were thought by the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> to be repugnant to Scripture, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Primitive Church, ſhould be able to admit of the Vanity and Abſurdity of Mahumetiſm: the Original and Progreſs of which is ſo well known to the <hi>Habeſsines</hi> already.</p>

                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:59633:178"/>A Religion that did not prevail by <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>well-doing</hi> like the Chriſtian Religion, but by force of Arms was obtruded upon Barbarous and Diſcording Nations. The Clergy and Monks ſo wedded to their <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Religion would no more endure it than they did the ſuperſtition of <hi>Suſneus.</hi> So that ſhould the King and his Peers be ſo vain as to attempt a thing ſo deteſtable to his People, he could not expect but to be more vigorouſly and generally oppos'd than ever his Father was. But laſtly, the King's Letters of the laſt Date to the Governor of <hi>Batavia</hi> beginning with a Chriſtian Preface ſufficiently demonſtrate, that he was a Chriſtian, when <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lez</hi> rais'd that report. However if any thing of freſher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence ſhall come to our hands at any time, we ſhall freely and truly impart it to Public view.</p>

                  <p>But as to what concerns our <hi>Ethiopic Letters,</hi> ſome of them indeed may correſpond in Name, but in ſhape there is not the leaſt appearance of ſimilitude: ſo that if an Argument were to be drawn from the Letters, we might ſay, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> receiv'd neither their Divine nor Civil Worſhip from the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Nevertheleſs they ſeem to have ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Characters, which many moſt Judicious Men acknowledge for the Original and Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Letters of the Ancient <hi>Hebrews:</hi> and yet neit her will theſe without a great deal of Labour, be brought to any Aſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

                  </p>
                  <p>They meddle with no Studies, but thoſe of their own Learned Language, and Sacred Matters. Moſt believe, they

have enough, if they can but Read and Write: and that either the Parents teach their Children to do, or elſe certain of their <hi>Monks</hi> for a ſmall ſtipend. They have no written Laws, Juſtice and Right is determined by Cuſtom, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their Anceſtors: and moſt differences are ended by the Will of the Judge.</p>
                  <p>Their manner of Adminiſtring <hi>Phyſick</hi> is moſt Deplorable, They Cure Men by cutting and burning, as they do Horſes. They cure the <hi>Yellow Jaundies,</hi> by applying a hot burning Iron in manner of a Semicircle, toward the upper end of the Arm, laying a little Cotton upon the Wound, that the Humour may iſſue forth, ſo long as the Diſeaſe remains. In moſt Diſtempers, every Perſon is his own Phyſitian, and uſes ſuch Herbs as he learnt were uſeful from his Parents. Some are of Opinion, that it is not a Pin matter, whether they make uſe of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> or Apothecaries or no, not believing it worth their while to be recover'd at ſo great Expences. If the King be ſick, they come to him, ask him, as if it were out of pity, <hi>What he ayles, and what is his Diſtemper?</hi> And if any one have been ill of the ſame Diſtemper, he tells, what did him good, deeming the ſame Remedies applicable to all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. If a Peſtilence chance to break out, they leave their Houſes and Villages, and retire with their Heards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mountains, putting all their Security in flying from the Contagion. <hi>Tertian Agues</hi> they Cure, by applying the <hi>Cramp-fiſh</hi> to the Patient, which is an unſpeakable Torture. <hi>Wounds</hi> they Cure by the help of <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> which is very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful among them.</p>
                  <p>I have not as yet ever ſeen the Treatiſe of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which I mention'd at the beginning of the Chapter; but it appears by the Theological Diſputations of their Divines, that they are none of the Acuteſt Logicians; nor have they any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Natural Philoſophy, as is apparent to any one that reads their Books, concerning the mixture of the Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Creation of Man; as alſo, concerning the Soul, the Author of the <hi>Organum</hi> gives this accompt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God made a Miracle when he Created our Father</hi> Adam, <hi>and Formed him of the Four Elements: he mixed the Elements, yet ſo that they ſhould not diſagree among themſelves; the Firſt with the Second, and the Third with the Fourth: he mix'd the dry with the Moiſt, and the Hot with the Cold; the Viſible with the Inviſible, the Palpable with the Impalpable: He made Two out of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59633:181"/>
and Two out of the Impalpable: He made Three of the Dry, and One of the Moiſt: He made Three out of the Viſible, and One out of the Inviſible. The great Architect knew where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Chamber was to be Seated, and plac'd the Corners of the Houſe in the Four</hi> Elements; <hi>and underſtanding that a veſſel of Clay could not move nor ſpeak, without the mixture of a Spirit that muſt come from Himſelf, therefore he Breath'd upon his Face and made him Rational and Self-moving; as ſaith the moſt Holy Law.</hi> He Breath'd into the Face of <hi>Adam,</hi> the breathing place of Life; and he became Man by the Breath of Life. <hi>Therefore the Soul dies not with the Body; for that proceeding out of the Mouth of the Lord, it was mixt with the Body: as ſaith our Lord in the Goſpel,</hi> Fear not thoſe who kill the Body, but cannot kill the Soul. <hi>Now as to what he ſaid,</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill the Soul; <hi>be ſpoke concerning the ſenſitive Soul: becauſe there are two Souls in Man; one the</hi> Spirit of Life, <hi>which proceeded out of the Mouth of God, not reckon'd among the</hi> Elements, <hi>and which never dyes. The other is, the</hi> Blood of the Body; <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> the Senſitive Soul, <hi>which has its Original from the</hi> Elements, <hi>and that is Morral. Wherefore God ſaid,</hi> Thou ſhalt not eat the Fleſh with the Blood; <hi>becauſe the Blood is the Senſitive Soul. But the Pillar of the Houſe of God, is the</hi> Spirit of Life. <hi>Now after the</hi> Spirit of Life <hi>is departed, the Body becomes a Carcaſs; therefore the Law pronounc'd the Carcaſs Unclean, becauſe the</hi> Spirit of Life <hi>is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from it. But among us, we reckon the Dead Body of a</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>to be clean, becauſe the Human Body was mix'd with the Blood of Divinity: beſides that the Grace of</hi> Baptiſm <hi>departs not from it: and concerning the Carcaſs of the</hi> Son of the Virgin, David <hi>ſaid,</hi> They caſt away their Brother as an unclean Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs. <hi>That is, they did not underſtand it to be holy; becauſe the</hi> Jews <hi>were his Brethren in reſpect of his Mother: and by their Law the Carcaſs was reputed unclean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be wondred, that the <hi>Habeſſines,</hi> who cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand two Natures in Chriſt united in one Exiſtence, ſhould find out two Souls in the body of Man. And yet it is no wonder when we conſider, that there are ſome, who imagine Three Souls in Man; whereas they might feign a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, ſhould they but take every Animal Faculty for a Soul.</p>
                  <p>But theſe, and ſuch like Conceptions admit of Excuſe and Interpretation, though what the vulgar believe concerning the <hi>Fabrick of the World,</hi> are altogether abſurd, and not worth
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59633:182"/>
relating, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Earth is a round Globe and pendent in the middle of the Air; this they look upon as a meer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What think ye, they would ſay, ſhould any one teach them, that the Planets are Animals, and inſtead of the Sun, that ſtands ſtill, always walking the rounds of the Heavens? Or aſſert the <hi>Antipodes</hi> to them, with their Feet upwards, and their Heads downwards, and yet keeping a ſteady Motion? certainly they would think, that ſuch people would neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drop into Heaven; though as to this we are not to deride their Ignorance, in regard ſeveral Holy and Grave Men have deny'd the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> nevertheleſs, they moſt idly dream that when the Sun riſes and ſets, he goes and comes again through a certain kind of Window; but which way he gets under the Earth, they are not very ſollicitous about: and yet in this, they ſeem much wiſer than <hi>Mahomet</hi> the great Prophet of the <hi>Muſſel-men,</hi> who fancy'd, That the Sun went to ſleep in a Well; <hi>Gregory</hi> was taken for a very great <hi>Philoſopher</hi> in his Country, for that he had made a certain Convex Model of Paſtboard, like the Arch of Heaven, to the inſide of which, he faſtned ſeveral graines of Wheat, to repreſent the Stars of the Firſt Magnitude, and then turn'd the Concavity upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to ſhew how the Heavens mov'd about the Earth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compas'd about by the Air.</p>
                  <p>As to the Liberal Arts they love <hi>Poeſie</hi> above all the reſt, but only that which is Divine: for Prophane Verſes they hate, which made <hi>Gregory</hi> extreamly wonder, that after the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Heathen Gods</hi> was quite taken away, and the Temples of their Gods were wholly deſtroyed, that the Books and Verſes which Treated or were Dedicated to them, were not as utterly Aboliſh'd. For that it was not fitting for Chriſtians to read the Rude and Obſcene Fables of their feigned Divinities, much leſs to imitate them, and fetch from thence the chief Ornaments of their Poems; ſeeing that the very Footſteps of Idolatry ought to be an abomination to Chriſtianity. Theſe Verſes of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> conſiſt in meer Rithmes; if we may Aſſert Conſonants of the ſame Order differing in the Vowels, to be Rithmes. For beſide thoſe, there is no other Matter to be obſerv'd: Of theſe they have ſeveral ſorts, as we ſhall teach in another Place. They are alſo very much delighted with abſtruſe Sayings and Proverbs; as for Example, <hi>The Mountains of</hi> Kobol <hi>as with a burning-Glaſs and ſo the prefix'd time of Man, is conſum'd by the paſſing of his days.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:59633:182"/>They are extreamly Covetous of Learning, and were extreamly importunate with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to teach their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the Latine Language. But they were more eager in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the <hi>Latine Religion,</hi> then the <hi>Language;</hi> pretending the difficulty of the Undertaking, and the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Amharic</hi> Pronounciation. Indeed, it cannot be deny'd, but that it is a moſt difficult thing to teach a Perſon who never heard of <hi>Grammar,</hi> as I found by the tryal of <hi>Gregory.</hi> For the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> learn Languages only by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, more eſpecially the <hi>Arabic,</hi> which is frequently ſpoken by the neighbouring Merchants, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the King, and the Courtiers themſelves; and in this Language the King Writes his Letters to Forrain Princes. On the otherſide the <hi>Arabians</hi> themſelves, as they are very much inclin'd to propagate their Fables among the Chriſtians, write them in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Language, but make uſe of the <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Letters, that thereby they may the more eaſily impoſe upon the ſimple people. Private perſons ſeldom write Letters, nor do they know the method of ſending them. But if any one has a deſire to write, he goes to the Scribe of the <hi>Province,</hi> who is call'd, <hi>Pahafe Hagare,</hi> and for a ſmall Sum of Money cauſes him to Compoſe them an <hi>Epiſtle:</hi> and you muſt know that the Exordiums of their Epiſtles are various in their Forms, for that in the Elegancy of their firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, they place the chiefeſt ornament of their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Domeſtick Oeconomie of the <hi>Habeſſines:</hi> Their Marriages, Dyet, Cloathing, Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Burials.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Their Marriages Chriſtian. <hi>Polygamy</hi> lawful by the Civil Laws, not by the Eccleſiaſtical. Divorces. Nuptial Ceremonies. Benediction Sacerdotal. Their Dyet raw Beef, or half boyl'd; and Herbs half con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by the Cattle. What Bread. Their way of making Butter. Their waſhing their Cloathes. Their Drink. Hydromel Ale. Their Cloathing thin. Very Parſimonious, accuſtom'd to go Naked. They Curl and anoint their Hair with Butter. Mean Habitations. The Kings Palaces. Their manner of bewailing the Dead. The Funeral Pomp of their Kings.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>Habeſſines</hi> Marry with every one of their Wives after the Chriſtian manner: neither are they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by any Law of the Land from Marrying ſeveral, though they are Prohibited by their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Penalties, as being contrary to the Sacred Canons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Chriſtians: and therefore they that Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>Polygamie</hi> are not admitted to the Communion, as we have already ſaid: For they are of that Opinion, That whatever is not prejudicial to the Publick, or to the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Tranquillity of private Perſons is not to be Proſecuted with ſecular Puniſhment; Neither are they ſcrupulous in ſuing out Divorces; aſſuming the ſame liberty to put away as to marry their Wives.</p>
                  <p>As for the particulars of their Nuptial Ceremonies, they are not of that importance as to Merit a Relation; nor are they the ſame in all Countries. Thoſe which <hi>Alvares</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, of the Nuptial Bed being brought forth and plac'd before the Doors of the Houſe by Three of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and then walking round it ſinging <hi>Hallelujas;</hi> or the cutting off the Locks of the Couple to be Wedded, for each to make an exchange, they were altogether unknown to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory;</hi> and that if it were the Cuſtom any where ſo to do, it was only as he ſaid, in ſome parts of <hi>Tygra:</hi> but that the <hi>Sacerdotal Benediction</hi> was neceſſary to all Weddings he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely granted.</p>
                  <p>Their Diet is not only very homely, but alſo far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:59633:184"/>
from ours; for they feed either upon raw Fleſh, or half boyl'd. <hi>Alvares</hi> gives you an Example of the Governour of <hi>Hangot, (Angot-Ras)</hi> who entertain'd <hi>Rodoric Limez</hi> at his Table with no other ſort of Junkets then ſuch mean Fare, very loathſom to the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Embaſſadour; for inſtead of Sauce they bring the Gall, which pleaſes their vitiated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates far better then Honey: but what is worſe than all this, they covet as a daintie, the half Concocted Graſs and green Herbs which they find in the Maws of the Beaſts which they kill, and greedily devour thoſe morſels, having firſt ſeaſon'd them with Pepper and Salt, as if the Beaſts better underſtood what Herbs were moſt wholſom then themſelves: a ſort of Dyet which none of our <hi>Europeans</hi> will envy them. Their Bread they bake upon the Embers, made in the faſhion of thin Pancakes, which they call <hi>Apas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have already declared, That in ſome of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Territories, the People live all upon Grazing; their Flocks and Herds are their only Riches, they eat their Fleſh, and drink their Milk. Thus that <hi>King and no King Jacob,</hi> lurking in the receſſes of the Rocks and Mountains, always carry'd his liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kitchen and Cellar with him, which were only three or four Goats at a time. Where the Air is temperate, they make excellent Butter and Cheeſe; but in the violent hot Countries they want that Food, by reaſon that the Exceſſive Heats hinder the Milk as well from thickning as turning. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their manner of Grinding is both very difficult and very laborious, for they put the Grain into a diſh, and rub it round about with a wodden Peſtel till it be all bruis'd; afterwards they ſift it, and make Bread of the Flower: this is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Maids and the Womens work, ſo that you cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Servants to this ſort of Labour: but the Men waſh their leathern, or woollen Clothes if they have any them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for Linnen is very ſcarce; and indeed the general Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings of their Nakedneſs, are the Skins of their own Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Their Drink is ſomewhat more dainty, and is the Glory and Conſummation of all their Feaſts; for ſo far they ſtill retain the Cuſtom of many of the Ancients, that as ſoon as the Table is clear'd, they fall to drinking; having always this Proverb in their mouths, <hi>That it is the uſual way to Plant firſt, and then to Water:</hi> they drink themſelves up to a merry Pitch, and till their Tongues run before their Wit, and never give off till the Drink be all out. They make excellent <hi>Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:59633:185"/>
by reaſon of their plenty of Honey, which inebriates like Wine, they call it <hi>Tzed;</hi> they make it ſmaller for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, mixing ſix parts of Wine, with one of Water. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Liquor they have of their Fruits; whether an Invention of their own, or that they learnt it from the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> they call it <hi>Tzal;</hi> and it may be ſaid to be a kind of Ale rather than Beer; as being boyl'd without Hopps, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not keep: it is white, and ſweet, inſomuch that our Ale was much more bitter to <hi>Gregories</hi> taſte.</p>
                  <p>Their Apparel is no leſs mean and poor, only the Princes wear Silk; the Clergy and richer ſort make uſe of Cotton: the poorer ſort half-naked, cover themſelves with Skins, that hardly hide their privy Parts; which is alſo common among ſome of the Nobility and Prieſthood: which by the <hi>Europeans</hi> would be lookt upon as a great Scandal, to appear in the Church or the Chancel without Breeches. However the more noble ſort wear a kind of Breeches, or rather Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes down to their heels, yet with ſuch a frugality, that the King is not aſham'd of; for from the Waſte to the Knees, ſo far as the cloak covers them, they are only Linnen or elſe of ſome courſer ſtuff, and only that which appears below is of Silk: nor are they concern'd though the other be ſeen as they ſit, or Mount their Horſes. The Boys and Girls go ſtark Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which the heat of the Country may excuſe, yet Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the main occaſion; till riper Years calls upon them to hide their Shame; yet then having been ſo accuſtomed to go Naked, they the leſs regard it. But what they want in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Habit, they endeavour to ſupply in the Ornament of their Hair, for you may ſafely ſay, it is a full year before they Trim and Comb themſelves. They not only curl their Hair which makes it grow the ſtreighter, but alſo anoint it, not with fragrant Balſoms, or Oyles of Amber or Musk, but with Butter; not conſidering that they who are forc'd to turn their Noſes from the ſtench of their Locks, have not the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to admire the luſtre of their Matted Treſſes: yet leſt an Ornament ſo ſlick and glittering ſhould be rumpl'd or ſqueez'd in the Night, they by means of a moſt exquiſite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention preſerve it, reſting their Necks in a forked ſtick, that ſo their Heads may hang at liberty, preferring their Pride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pain and Torture.</p>
                  <p>Nor does their Poverty leſs appear in their Houſes, for they that belong to the Camp, live all either in Tents, or in
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59633:185"/>
Hurts made up of Reeds and Rubbiſh, daub'd over with Clay or Lome, and cover'd with Straw or Sedge, which they leave behind them when they remove their Camp with no dammage, or condoling for the loſs of their Tenement, when they can as eaſily build another at the ſame rate. Not much better are their Villages, ſcarce ſecure againſt the Incurſions of the Beaſts of Prey. The <hi>Cafers</hi> like Wild Beaſts lye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Curtains or Canopie than that of Heaven, in the open Field, where Night conſtrains them to reſt. The Kings Houſes are of two Faſhions, the Longer which are call'd <hi>Sakala;</hi> and the Rounder, which if they be bigger then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, are call'd <hi>Beta Negus,</hi> tho Kings Houſes.</p>
                  <p>They bewail their Dead after a moſt doleful manner; for no ſooner do they hear of the Death of any great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, or any near Friend, but they proſtrate themſelves upon the Ground, where they lye knocking and bruiſing their Heads againſt it, with a cruelty very injurious to their Sculls. The Funeral of <hi>Suſneus</hi> as being moſt Remarkable, I ſhall here ſet down, to ſhew their ſolemnities in burying their Kings. The Body, being wrapt up and covered with a moſt rich and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Garment, was carryed from <hi>Dancaza,</hi> where the Camp then lay, to the Church call'd <hi>Ganeta—Jeſus.</hi> Before the Hearſe the Banners and Enſignes were born, not Revers'd, as among us, but upright and diſplay'd, without any <hi>Impreſes</hi> or <hi>Motto's,</hi> but only adorn'd with various Colours: the Drums beat ſlow and mournfully: after them followed Three of the beſt Horſes which the King us'd to Ride, Magnificently capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, as if it had been for ſome Triumphal Pomp: next to them follow'd ſeveral of the Noblemens Sons, carrying the Kings Royal Robes, and Enſigns of Regality, as his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem, his Sword, his Belt, his Spear, his Buckler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taking their turns, and by their geſtures and poſtures uſing all means to excite the People to Tears and Lamentation. To the ſame End the Queen her ſelf, following at a good diſtance wore upon her Head her Husbands particular Diadem; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with her Daughters and all the Ladies and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of Noble Extraction, all riding upon <hi>Mules,</hi> and having their Treſſes cut off: after them followed the Kings Son and Succeſſor, with his Brothers and all the Nobility, ſome on Horſeback, and ſome on Foot, in old tatter'd Habits, inſtead of Mourning: no Torches or <hi>Flambeaus</hi> lighted them along in their Proceſſion: no Tapers burning in the Church, nor
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:59633:186"/>
was any thing to be heard from one end to the other of it, but Groans and Lamentations, till the Body was laid in the Tomb: only ſome few <hi>Monks</hi> ſtanding before the Doors of the Church, read ſome few of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> Next day they return'd to <hi>Dancaza;</hi> and then ſo ſoon as they came in ſight of the place, another ſort of Pomp was order'd. For the Hearſe being brought back again empty, was carry'd firſt, by which rode a certain Horſeman, adorn'd with the Emperours Habit and Robes; and before him rode another upon a Horſe richly capariſon'd, and arm'd with Helmet and Spear: in which manner after they had proceeded a little way, ſome certain Bands of Armed Soldiers March'd forth of the Camp to meet them, teſtifying their Sorrow, by their bitter Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Howlings. Then the Princes of the Kingdome and chiefeſt Lords of the Court entring the new Kings Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, renewed their Moans with all expreſſions of Sorrow, and concluded the Solemnity at length, with congratulations and well-wiſhes for his happy Government, and proſperous ſucceſs in all his undertakings.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of their Mechanic Arts and Trades.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>Very few Handicrafts. The <hi>Jews</hi> Weavers and Smiths. No Societies of Trades-men. Certain Families of Trumpeters. Architecture formerly known, now forgotten; compar'd with the Ancient <hi>Germans.</hi> Churches and Colledges built by the Fathers of the Societie. The Kings <hi>Palace</hi> Built after the <hi>European</hi> manner, admir'd. They are covetous of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sciences. What the King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> chiefly wants.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALL this while, there is nothing of which they ſtand more in need then of Handicraft Trades: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are deſtitute of ſo many conveniencies of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life, as we abound in by the help of our Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. The <hi>Jews</hi> are almoſt the only perſons that employ themſelves among them in weaving of Cotton: they alſo make the Heads of their Spears and ſeveral other pieces of Workmanſhip in Iron, for they are excellent Smiths; a ſort of Trade otherwiſe abhorr'd by the <hi>Habeſſines;</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> confirm'd with a ſmile; ſaying, That the ſilly vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not endure Smiths, <hi>as being a ſort of Mortals that
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:59633:186"/>
ſpit fire, and were bred up in Hell.</hi> As for other things, every one takes Care to ſupply his own wants either by his own or the pains of his Servants, which it is no hard matter to do; conſidering how little they have to uſe. And for the great Men, they have particular men for all their particular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: therefore there are no <hi>Guilds,</hi> or Fraternities of Trades-men among them, which are ſo frequent in all our Cities, who have their By-laws contriv'd by themſelves, more for the good of themſelves, than for the benefit of the Commonweale: for amongſt us, the skilful and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the juſt dealer and unjuſt, are all alike; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all under the ſame By-laws; and they exerciſe a kind of Monopolie of their Trade, ſo that their fellow Citizens are as it were Forraigners among them, and compell'd to obey their Injunctions. But in <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> what ever Art any one Profeſſes, that he teaches his Children. The <hi>Trumpeters</hi> and <hi>Horn-winders</hi> are all of the ſame Families, and have their particular Country and Manſions by themſelves. Formerly <hi>Architecture,</hi> as it was in requeſt, ſo it was an Art well known among them, as is evident by the Ruines of the City of <hi>Axuma,</hi> and the Structures of Magnificent Temples cut out of the Live Stone Rocks: but the Imperial Seat being removed into <hi>Amhara,</hi> it grew out of date. For the Kings having deſerted <hi>Axuma,</hi> by reaſon of their long and frequent Marches being accuſtomed to their Camps, rather choſe to abide in Tents and Pavillions. Beſides that, after the havocks of the <hi>Adelan</hi> Wars, and the Invaſions of the <hi>Gallans,</hi> found that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns</hi> and <hi>Receſſes</hi> of their Inacceſſible Mountains were far more ſafe and convenient and better ſhelter then ſumptuous Palaces. Therefore what <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath written concerning our Ancient <hi>Germans,</hi> may be rightly apply'd to the <hi>Habeſſines. It is ſufficiently known, that Cities are not inhabited by any of the</hi> Habeſſine <hi>People, neither do they permit contiguous Buildings among them. They place their Villages not as we do, building our Houſes cloſe one to another; but every one encompaſſes to himſelf a ſpace of ground peculiar to his Habitation, whether to prevent the accidents of Fire, or whether it be their ignorance in the Art of Building. They neither uſe Cement or Tiles, the whole compoſure of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks, being all of rude and Courſe Materials, without the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Elegancy or Ornament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Fathers of the Societies, having deſign'd their <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Structures before, carry'd an <hi>Architect</hi> with them out of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59633:187"/>
                     <hi>India,</hi> and having found out Lime, unknown to the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> for ſo many Ages, built their Churches and their Colledges of Stone and Mortar, and encompaſs'd them with High-walls, to the amazement and dread of the <hi>Habeſſines,</hi> leſt they ſhould in time be made ſo many Impregnable Forts and Caſtles. But there was nothing which they ſo much admir'd as the Palace which they built for the King; of which the chief Architect was <hi>Peter Pays,</hi> both Labourer and Work-maſter, both Surveyer, Carpenter, and Maſon himſelf, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor of others. A Work which afterwards the People from all parts of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> far and near flock't to ſee. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> have a great deſire to learn all thoſe Arts and Sciences which are neceſſary both in Peace and War, is apparent by King <hi>David</hi>'s Letter to <hi>John</hi> the Third King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Pilgrimages now rare. They Travel upon Mules. No Inns or Wagons. Their Hoſpitality. The way into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> dangerous. An account of the ſeveral ways to it.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HOwever in the midſt of all this penury of <hi>Exotic</hi> Arts and Conveniencies, the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord never care to ſtir out of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as being ignorant of Forraign Languages and Regions; nor can they diſtinguiſh between the <hi>European</hi> Nations, which they believe to be all <hi>Franks,</hi> and their Religion the <hi>Latine Worſhip;</hi> only they can tell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Neither do they underſtand the way of Exchange,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59633:187"/>
or keeping Correſpondence: Beſides, they are deterr'd by their own Poverty from undertaking ſuch dangerous Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys through ſo many uncouth Deſerts.</p>
                  <p>Formerly indeed they frequently made their holy Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> when the <hi>Mamalucks</hi> were Lords of <hi>Egypt;</hi> their Government being more gentle, and the ways then far leſs dangerous then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but the Covetouſneſs of the <hi>Turks</hi> has quite alter'd the Caſe, for the Baſha's and Governours of the Iſlands of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and the upper <hi>Egypt,</hi> Men for the moſt part of baſe and ſordid Condition, having bought their Employments at Court with Mony, without any ſenſe of Law or Equity, ſo torment and vex all ſorts of Travellers, and ſuck the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Purſes in ſuch manner, though to the utter impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the Subject and utter decay of Trade, have ruin'd all Commerce and Society with thoſe Places: ſo that the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſines</hi> now very rarely viſit <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and more rarely go to abide there, as they were wont. For though there, they are ſomewhat more free from the exactions of the Church, yet are they more oppreſs'd by want; in regard that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues ſettled by the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> Kings upon Pilgrims in thoſe Parts, are in the hands of the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſo that unleſs the Alms of the Place which are very ſparing, God knows, ſupport them, hunger preſently deſtroys them.</p>
                  <p>In their Travelling, they only make uſe of Mules; neither can any other Creature perform that kindneſs to Man as they do, over ſo many craggie Rocks and Mountains, where it is impoſſible for Waggons, Carts, or Coaches to paſs. Their Horſes they preſerve very charily for War, and Racing. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> wondred when he ſaw our cover'd Wains: He call'd that wherein He and I travell'd together <hi>Bet,</hi> a Houſe, and wiſh'd he had ſuch a one to carry him into <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> The Great Men and richer ſort, carry all their Domeſtick Houſhold-ſtuff along with them upon their Mules; and where Night over-takes 'em, there they pitch their Tents, and kindle Fires about them to skare the Wild Beaſts. The poorer ſort; when they have occaſion to Travel beg upon the Rode; for there is not an Inn to be ſeen among them; and for Cooks Shops and Ordinaries, they know as little what belongs to them. Upon which happen'd a pleaſant accident at <hi>Rome.</hi> Where the ſimple <hi>Habeſſines</hi> newly arriv'd out of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> being walking in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> were invited by a Cook into
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59633:188"/>
his Shop. They believing all Invitations to be made <hi>gratis,</hi> at firſt admir'd the Hoſpitallity of the Man; but then conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it might be done out of Curioſity, to ſee and diſcourſe with ſtrangers, went into the Shop, and very chearfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of what was ſet before them: but at length, when they were going away, they conſulted together for Phraſe and Language to return their thanks to ſo kind an Hoſt for his liberal Entertainment, which one among the reſt, who beſt underſtood the Language was to deliver to the Cook in the behalf of his Companions. The Cook having liſten'd a while to their Learned Speech, and not hearing a word of any Mony, without any reſpect to the ſmoothneſs of their Language, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>who pays?</hi> The <hi>Habeſſines</hi> like Men Aſtoniſh'd made anſwer, <hi>That they came not into his Shop of their own accord, but by his Invitation, without any mention made of Expectancy of Payment; and that he, when he ſet his Wine and his Meat before them, never bargain'd for any Money, for that was the very thing they wanted.</hi> But all this would not ſatisfie the Cook, who forc'd them to leave their Cloaks in Pawn, which were afterwards redeem'd at the <hi>Popes</hi> Charity, which made the Courtiers not a little Merry.</p>
                  <p>However the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> themſelves are not ignorant of Hoſpitality, for that in their Villages they appoint the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Inhabitants for the Relief of the Poor: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Exerciſe of Hoſpitallity is highly recommended by the <hi>Apoſtolical Doctrine,</hi> for the Relief of poor People driven from their abodes by the misfortunes of War, or other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. Nor were our Anceſtors defective in their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity, as having founded ſeveral Magnificent Pallaces, and endowed them with ample Revenues, were they but employ'd according to the Founders Deſign.</p>
                  <p>And here it may be very proper to ſet down the ſeveral ways that lead into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> by Land, and where they that go by Sea are to put in for a Landing Place.</p>
                  <p>The way from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Habeſſinia</hi> is moſt troubleſome, difficult, and ſubject to many dangers, as well by reaſon of the Extortions of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Robberies committed by ſeveral vagabond Nations, through which they are to paſs, and the unwholeſomneſs of the Climates; though formerly when thoſe Kingdoms and Satrapies were under a ſtricter Government, the Paſſage was ſafe enough, and more frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Nevertheleſs there are at this day ſeveral Troops of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59633:188"/>
Merchants, who ſetting out from <hi>Gran Caire,</hi> are carry'd up the <hi>Nile</hi> againſt the Stream as far as <hi>Monfallot,</hi> and thence Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in <hi>Caravans,</hi> firſt come to <hi>Sijut,</hi> and ſo in order to the following Towns.</p>

There is another way by Sea, round about <hi>Africa;</hi> but then you put in to ſome Port of <hi>Africa,</hi> that ſo you may take your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get into the <hi>Perſian Gulph:</hi> Many would prefer this way as moſt facile, tho tedious and troubleſom had the <hi>Habeſſines</hi> any Sea Port at their Command. They that have buſineſs at <hi>Moccha</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> have the advantage of croſſing over to <hi>Matzua</hi> that lyes over againſt it; and ſo from <hi>Arkiko</hi> the Paſſage lies eaſie: nor do they amiſs that make for <hi>Baylur</hi> a Sea Port belonging to the King of <hi>Denkala,</hi> in Amity with the <hi>Habeſſines;</hi> only the Journey by Land from thence is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and very much infeſted by the Robberies of the <hi>Gallans;</hi> though they that can Travel with a good Band of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers need little fear them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zeyla</hi> a Port belonging to the <hi>Adelans</hi> is more Remote, and altogether unſafe, becauſe of the deadly hatred between them and the <hi>Habeſſines;</hi> as two of the Fathers of the Society found true. For miſtaking this Port, for that of <hi>Baylur,</hi> they paid for their miſtake with the loſs of their Heads. The other more <hi>Southern</hi> Ports as <hi>Melinda, Magodoſh,</hi> &amp;c. are too far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the <hi>Habeſſines;</hi> beſides the whole Region is Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited with none but wild and ſavage People, whoſe petty Princes are in continual Wars one with another, and exerciſe their Fury againſt all Strangers as Spies, nor are there any Guides to be found.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Merchandize, and Exchange of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize in <hi>Habeſſinia.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> chiefly, next the <hi>Armenians</hi> the chief Merchants; all bargains by Exchange, of Gold, Iron, Salt. What Goods Exported, what Imported.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FRom what hath been ſaid, it appears that the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are no way addicted or expert in the Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues of Merchandizing; for they that will not Travel into Forraign Parts muſt yield their gains to others; for gain is to be ſought, not coming of it ſelf. Therefore the <hi>Arabians</hi> who Inhabit the Ports of the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> ſcattered over the Kingdom, are the Chief Merchants in <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> for being of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they have the free liberty of all the Ports of the <hi>Red Sea:</hi> next to theſe the <hi>Armenians,</hi> not much differing in their Form of Worſhip, from the <hi>Abeſſines,</hi> carry the greateſt Trade, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Dealers in all parts of the World. They Import ſundry ſorts of Commodities, but carry out all the Gold; that 'tis no wonder the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> ſhould be ſo poor: for neither Gold nor Silver is imported into their Country, but only an Exchange is made for <hi>Indian</hi> Wares. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no Money coin'd in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the more ſilly and ignorant ſort of People, becauſe they come eaſily by their Gold, as finding it among the Sand, or at the Roots of Trees, let it go again at low Rates. For if the Merchant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be good, they exchange it for as much as they can get, never queſtioning the Merchants exception. But the Nobility and more cunning ſort, carry a Touch-ſtone always about 'em, with which they try their Gold, then weigh it out, and pay it by the Ounce. The <hi>Ethiopic Vaket,</hi> or Ounce amounts, as <hi>Gregory</hi> told me, to the value of the <hi>Spaniſh Patacoon,</hi> or our Imperial <hi>Dollar:</hi> Therefore it is, that Exchange is far more frequent in <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> then buying and ſelling; which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is made with Iron ſometimes, but chiefly for Salt hewn out of the Mountains; which in moſt Countrys ſupplies the Place of Mony, with which you may purchaſe all things. In the more remote Parts of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> you may buy a good

                     <hi>Mule</hi> with two or three Bricks of that Salt. Formerly Pepper had the ſame pre-eminence.</p>
                  <p>The Commodities Imported, are <hi>Babylonian</hi> Garments of all ſorts, Velvet, Silken; but chiefly Woollen and Fuſtian, which the great Men wear inſtead of Purple, which at this day they have loſt the skill of Dying. Spices, and eſpecially Pepper they covet to ſeaſon their inſipid Dyet. Wares for Exportation they have few, beſides Gold, Skins, Hides, Wax, Honey, and Ivory: ſcarce any thing elſe remarkable. Many more they certainly might have, did the <hi>Habeſſinian</hi> Kings encourage Traffick and Merchandizing, and if the Country were more commodious for Carriage. The beſt Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize in <hi>Habeſſinia,</hi> and moſt important for the Prince, were a more cultivated Ingenuity of the People; together with a perfect knowledge of the Latine Language, together with addition of our Arts, and Handicraft Trades, which would advance the Affairs of thoſe poor Chriſtians to a more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Eſtate, and weaken the ſtrength of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Almighty God ſtir up the Hearts of our Princes, to lend their Aſſiſtance to this Ancient Chriſtian Nation, which might prove ſo uſeful to Propagate Chriſtianity in thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Parts of the World; and ſo glorious to themſelves and their Poſterity.</p>
